A culture of growth and meaningful work Leadership Founder's perspective I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO The opportunity to reshape the future is now I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap. I envisioned a society where everything just works. Everything happens in the background seamlessly, so citizens and businesses can focus on what truly matters—what they care about and what creates value. I wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and automate any task that does not need a human to perform it. I believed digitalization could unlock this potential—and so much more. Today, Estonia is the first country where all government services are 100% digital, and Nortal has grown into a global player, helping governments across North America, Europe and the Middle East create digital solutions that are citizen-centered, resilient, and deliver real outcomes. Many of my dreams have already come true, and I’m proud of our role in making that happen. But the world is changing faster than ever. Artificial intelligence, globalization, energy and climate crises, geopolitical tensions, and a generation of kids growing up in a fully digital world are reshaping what we expect from society. As the world changes, we need to have the will and courage to dream and reinvent the future we want our children to inherit. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO Delivering value across industries Public Sector Transforming governments in the digital age.

    "content": "Government efficiency in the age of AI This white paper explores how applying democratic design principles to digital infrastructure creates governments that are both more capable and more trusted. Get the white paper Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? The race between digital democracy and digital control Digital technology is redefining how governments operate. It can make institutions faster and more effective, or more centralized and opaque. The next decade will decide whether AI-enabled governments evolve as open, participatory systems or drift toward digital authoritarianism. The architecture built today will determine how freedom, trust and efficiency coexist in the decades to come. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. Explore system-level efficiency Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for whole-of-government system efficiency The paper introduces system-level efficiency as a new benchmark for digital governance. It measures performance not by speed or cost alone but by how well digital systems reinforce trust, capacity and adaptability across government. System-level efficiency arises when operational performance, state capacity and public trust advance together, constrained by four strategic factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Explore the new governance benchmark A roadmap to efficient digital democracy The white paper outlines three stages for governments pursuing both efficiency and legitimacy: Build a trusted foundation. Base registries, digital identity, data exchange and transparency tools give citizens confidence and control. Increase intelligence. Integrate systems to enable proactive, AI-supported services that remain explainable and fair. Prepare for democratic cyberocracy. Leverage data and AI for real-time governance while preserving oversight, participation and the rule of law.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe white paper discusses how applying democratic design principles to digital infrastructure can enhance government efficiency and trust. It highlights the potential of AI and real-time data to improve public service delivery while cautioning against risks of centralization and reduced transparency. The paper introduces system-level efficiency as a benchmark for digital governance, emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and pluralism.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The white paper explores the impact of AI on government efficiency and trust.\n- It warns of the risks of centralization and reduced transparency with digital technology.\n- System-level efficiency is introduced as a benchmark for digital governance.\n- The paper outlines a roadmap for efficient digital democracy with three stages.\n- Democratic design principles are crucial for enhancing government efficiency.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment Efficiency, AI and Democracy, Digital Governance, Public Trust, System-Level Efficiency",

Pandemics, conflicts, and climate change are testing the resilience of our institutions and democracy. Nearly 30% of governments in Europe had to postpone elections during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, highlighting the need for digital continuity of state functions in the face of challenges. As a result, policymakers are now making large investments into their digital capabilities to ensure the digital continuity of state functions during times of crisis.

Get the white paper Service Cyber Resilience Industry Logistics The convergence of IT, OT, and emerging AI has unlocked unprecedented efficiency across port operations. At the same time, it has erased traditional security boundaries — introducing new forms of risk that extend far beyond data loss. Can smart ports deliver efficiency without exposing operations and global supply chains to systemic cyber risk? Cyber risk is no longer just digital Cyber threats are no longer confined to data theft; they now pose a direct risk of operational paralysis, physical sabotage, and systemic supply chain disruption that can ripple across the globe. A single, well-executed cyber incident can bring a major port to a standstill — incurring millions in losses per day and triggering cascading failures across international supply chains. Read the white paper €200k per hour is the estimated downtime cost for one large port in UK. €95B could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region 90% of port and terminal executives felt \"Very confident\" in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering.. 45% of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach that year before. Despite clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within maritime leadership, creating one of the most significant strategic blind spots. When the perimeter disappears The traditional approach to cybersecurity, built around strong perimeters and assumed trust, is no longer sufficient in a hyper-connected port ecosystem. True resilience requires a shift from reactive, compliance-driven security toward strategies designed for an assumed-breach reality. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for maritime cyber resilience This white paper moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience — combining resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defence.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe article discusses the challenges and strategies for achieving cyber resilience in smart ports, emphasizing the convergence of IT, OT, and AI, which has increased efficiency but also introduced new security risks. It highlights the significant economic impact of cyber incidents on ports and the need for a shift from traditional cybersecurity approaches to more resilient, adaptive strategies.

    "content": "Home Insights Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Article March 13, 2025 James Thomas, Global Head of Cyber | Michael Hampson Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. Download the Embedding resilience paper Service Cyber Resilience Strategy and Transformation It’s not a question of if you will be attacked; it’s a question of when. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 99% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months A resilient culture This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience—embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer-centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. Investing in cyber resilience The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe article emphasizes the inevitability of cyberattacks and advocates for a shift from prevention to cyber resilience, integrating security into all aspects of an organization's operations. It highlights the importance of a resilient culture where cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and embedded into daily operations and decision-making. The approach is essential as digital transformation expands the threat landscape, requiring continuous adaptation and leadership commitment.\n\n## Key Facts\n- 42% of organizations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024.\n- 99% of organizations expect an increase in cyberattacks in terms of volume or costliness in the coming year.\n- 29% of organizations were materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months.\n- Cyber resilience should be embedded throughout an organization's operating model to support digital initiatives.\n- Cybersecurity must evolve into an organization-wide imperative, much like digitalization and customer-centricity.\n\n## Topics\nCyber resilience, Digital transformation, Security strategy, Organizational culture, Cybersecurity integration",

    "content": "When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Measuring the impact €10.5tn is the predicted cost of cybercrime globally in 2025 €4.66m was the average cost of a data breach ion 2024 €4.76m was the average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 The cost of cyber resilience So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: How does the organisation make money or deliver value? What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/or services provided? What is the threat to each? Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. The building blocks of embedding resilience A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation. 01. Governance & strategy The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program.\n\n---\n## Summary\nIn today's interconnected world, cyber resilience is crucial for businesses as data breaches pose significant threats. Despite being seen as a tradeable commodity due to budget constraints, organizations can quantify the ROI of cyber resilience by developing frameworks that assess both direct and indirect returns.

    "content": "Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers. This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability.

Learn more from our white paper Trust as both enabler and dependency The paradox of digital transformation – trust is needed to invest public capital in digital transformation, and at the same time, digital transformation will result in trust. It is both an outcome of the process and a necessary precondition for it. But such a virtuous cycle, where the initial trust level enables a digital service uptake and the usage of the same services starts to increase, trust can only be kickstarted when the initial trust level is there. From a certain level of digital maturity onward – like moving from traditional e-government to personal government – trust becomes a core enabler of governance as citizen willingness to share their data is a technical necessity of the system. Download the full white paper Formula for creating trust in digital government Extensive research across multiple domains, from interpersonal relationships to government, has revealed a consistent formula for trust, defined by reliability, fairness, and transparency, with execution playing a key role. This white paper explores these concepts and offers practical, tech-driven strategies for governments to rebuild trust and improve service delivery.

While technology promises faster, more efficient and more adaptive public institutions, it also raises risks of over-centralization, weakened accountability and “digital authoritarianism.” Government efficiency and democratic principles are not competing goals. Instead, when designed intentionally, digital government can and should embed democratic values, such as participation, transparency, competition, subsidiarity, accountability and inclusion, directly into its architecture, creating nations that are both more efficient and more democratic. The paper proposes whole-of-government system-level efficiency as an important benchmark for public sector performance. System-level efficiency consists of operational efficiency, state capacity and public trust. These outcomes are constrained by four cross-cutting factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Short-term efficiency achieved by centralization may erode resilience and trust, while federated and modular systems, though more complex, foster adaptability and long-term performance. Democracy itself is shown to be the most system-efficient governance model: its design principles – representation, accountability, pluralism, subsidiarity, checks and balances and shared civic identity – optimize outcomes and use of resources across multiple functions simultaneously against the maximum potential. Translated into digital government, these principles guide choices around open standards, federated data architectures, algorithmic transparency and citizen participation, in turn optimizing for long-term system-level efficiency. The core thesis of this paper is thus: In pursuit of government efficiency through technology, the policy and technological decisions we make in designing the digital government are in fact steering us more toward a digital democracy or digital autocracy. In optimizing for long-term efficiency against maximum potential, we must in fact turn to democratic principles and implement them in digital government. In doing so, we not only increase government efficiency but also reinforce democracy. The paper outlines a three-stage roadmap toward efficient digital democracy: 1. Build a secure and trusted foundation – with base registries, digital identity, federated data exchange and transparency tools to give citizens visibility and control over data use. If implemented right, it sets a strong democratic, equitable and efficient foundation for government. 2.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses how artificial intelligence and digital technologies are transforming government operations, emphasizing the need to integrate democratic values into digital governance to avoid risks like over-centralization and digital authoritarianism. It proposes a roadmap for achieving efficient digital democracy by building a secure foundation, ensuring transparency, and fostering citizen participation. The paper argues that democratic principles enhance both government efficiency and democratic integrity in digital governance.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The paper emphasizes the integration of democratic values such as participation and transparency into digital government systems.\n- It identifies system-level efficiency as a benchmark for public sector performance, involving operational efficiency, state capacity, and public trust.\n- The document outlines a three-stage roadmap toward digital democracy, starting with building a secure and trusted foundation.\n- Democracy is highlighted as the most system-efficient governance model due to its design principles like representation and accountability.\n- The paper warns against the risks of over-centralization and digital authoritarianism in the pursuit of government efficiency.\n\n## Topics\nDigital government, Democratic principles, Government efficiency, Artificial intelligence, Digital democracy",

    "content": "Increase intelligence in government systems and services – horizontally and vertically integrating domains to move toward proactive and agentic service delivery while balancing deterministic automation with AI. 3. Prepare for digital democracy and cyberocratic governance – a model of “rule by information” that leverages real-time data and AI for policymaking while reinforcing, not eroding, democratic accountability, oversight and participation. Democratic processes must also evolve and adapt to these new capabilities. Our conclusion is that governments can leverage technologies and become more efficient without compromising the fundamental values of democracy. In fact, as we have argued, those democratic principles are themselves drivers of long-term efficiency and performance. A digital government built on these foundations will not only achieve better outcomes – it will also strengthen the democratic fabric, ensuring that efficiency gains endure and benefit government and society as a whole. 7 Introduction 2. 8 As governments adopt increasingly capable AI-based systems, nations and the bureaucratic organizations that run them will be fundamentally transformed. The emerging era of AI-enabled governments will be defined by a growth in the creation and usage of data, increasing levels of automation, and run the risk of increasing the distance felt between governments and the governed. What this future looks like, and whether these governments will be more authoritarian or democratic, remains to be seen. But both futures are plausible. A decade from now, citizens will live inside the digital institutions we are designing and building today – the choices made today matter and will influence which future prevails. We believe in the importance of a strong, digital and democratic future. That is why, in this paper, we argue and show that government efficiency and democratic principles are not in conflict. In fact, when democratic principles are properly operationalized, they lead to greater system-wide efficiency. Principles such as transparency, auditability, participation, collaboration, competition and decentralization are essential for delivering better services, strengthening state capacity and deepening public trust. However, these aims are only achievable if architecture is treated as policy, and policy as architecture. The responsibility for building more robust, resilient and democratic digital systems, therefore, lies not only with ministers or rule-makers but also with CIOs, CTOs, CDOs, product owners and system architects. The code they approve, the standards they establish and the contracts they sign will influence institutions toward either openness or control, competition or monopoly, growth or stagnation. These are political choices, often disguised as purely technical decisions.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the integration of AI and digital systems in government to enhance efficiency while maintaining democratic principles. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, participation, and decentralization in building robust digital governance. The paper argues that democratic values drive long-term efficiency and that the design choices made today will shape the future of governance.\n\n## Key Facts\n- AI and digital systems can enhance government efficiency while maintaining democratic principles.\n- Transparency, participation, and decentralization are crucial for effective digital governance.\n- Design choices in digital systems today will influence future governance structures.\n- Democratic principles can drive long-term efficiency in government systems.\n- Technical decisions in digital governance are inherently political choices.\n\n## Topics\nAI in government, Digital governance, Democratic principles, Government efficiency, Future of governance",

    "content": "As these diverse groups of stakeholders collaborate to shape the future of AI-enabled governments, it is crucial to avoid shortcuts and the temptation of highly centralized systems that, outwardly, seem more efficient. Such an approach might produce quick results, but in the long run, these systems are likely to fail. Not only are centralized systems less robust, but they also erode the trust necessary for supporting continued legitimate democratic governance. Instead, governments should support systems that are distributed and self-organizing, governed by clear standards and shared values. This involves adopting open standards instead of proprietary single-vendor solutions to foster market competition; integrating auditability and explainability into systems and algorithms to ensure accountability; facilitating open and inclusive participation channels; and federating data and services so that decisions occur at the lowest effective level. None of this suggests being naive about AI. Governments should automate deterministically where legal frameworks and data quality permit, applying AI thoughtfully in contexts where pattern recognition, scale or complexity surpass human capabilities. Human in the loop by default, well-documented models and data provenance, transparency of data processing, human control over their data, algorithmic transparency and independent oversight are not optional extras; they are essential for legitimacy at scale. In the following sections of this report, we define government efficiency and provide an overview of how democratic principles drive excellence in digital architecture and service design. The report then provides a roadmap for building efficient digital democracies: (1) build a secure, trusted foundation (e.g., base registries, digital identity, once-only data exchange); (2) increase intelligence and responsiveness across information systems and services (from common standards to agentic, self- organizing models); and (3) prepare for cyberocratic governance – governance by information that remains firmly under the rule of law. Finally, the report offers key recommendations for putting these principles into practice. 9 Government efficiency and democratic principles 3. 10 Whole-of-government system-level efficiency Operational efficiency Improving the internal performance of government operations and service delivery. This means achieving more output or higher quality services, with the same or fewer resources. Examples include faster processing times, reduced administrative costs, streamlined user journeys and less paperwork for citizens, companies and civil servants. Operational efficiency often represents the most visible early gain from digital transformation, but by itself it is insufficient. State capacity (effectiveness) Enhancing the government’s ability to design, implement and enforce policies and core functions.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document emphasizes the importance of distributed and self-organizing systems in AI-enabled governments to maintain democratic governance and avoid centralized systems that may erode trust. It advocates for open standards, transparency, and accountability in digital architectures to enhance government efficiency and service delivery. The report outlines a roadmap for building digital democracies, focusing on secure foundations, intelligence in information systems, and preparation for cyberocratic governance.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Centralized systems in AI-enabled governments risk eroding trust and failing in the long term.\n- Governments should adopt open standards and ensure transparency and accountability in digital systems.\n- A roadmap for digital democracies includes secure foundations, intelligent systems, and cyberocratic governance.\n- Operational efficiency in government involves faster processing and reduced costs, but is not sufficient alone.\n- The report emphasizes the importance of human oversight and transparency in AI applications.\n\n## Topics\nAI-enabled governments, Digital democracy, Government efficiency, Open standards, Operational efficiency",

    "content": "State capacity refers to the government’s ability to collect revenue, maintain rule of law, deliver public goods and respond to societal needs. Technology can strengthen state capacity by improving data quality for decision making, improving coordination among agencies, and enabling proactive and preventive interventions. Strong state capacity allows government to translate policy into tangible outcomes. Public trust Strengthening citizens’ trust in government by improving transparency, integrity and user experience. Trust is both an outcome and a critical enabler of government efficiency: high-trust environments make policy implementation easier and encourages citizen cooperation, improves voluntary compliance and lowers transaction costs. Without trust, even the most technically efficient systems risk underperformance or public resistance. Across eras, governments turn to new tools to solve recurring problems: seeing society clearly, coordinating action, moving resources and securing borders. Each wave – from roads and censuses to the telegraph, electrification, digitalization and today’s AI – cuts transaction costs, speeds decisions and extends government’s reach and capacity, making services cheaper and more predictable at home while signaling reliability and competitiveness abroad. Adoption typically accelerates under crisis, fiscal pressure or strategic rivalry, when not adopting becomes costlier than change. Governments embrace technology chiefly to do more with less (operational efficiency), have more impact in doing so (state capacity) and to earn and sustain public trust: 3.1 Achieving progress in all these areas simultaneously – operational efficiency, state capacity and public trust – is what we refer to as system-level efficiency of governance, which must be evaluated against their maximum potential (e.g. is the system of governance maximizing use of resources and individuals and society to its maximum potential). Thus, we define the purpose of government system-level efficiency to maximize the use of resources and individuals for the benefit of the society as a whole. To achieve system-level efficiency, these three facets must be interrelated. For example, operational efficiencies can free resources that improve services (bolstering both effectiveness and 11 Complexity As government systems and processes grow complexity, complicatedness becomes the enemy of efficiency. Complexity itself is not the problem per se, but complicatedness. Highly complicated, fragmented processes and systems are harder to change or improve, and they increase the risk of failures. Simplifying processes, using modular architectures, and focusing on interoperability standards are strategies to tame complexity. If complexity is not (self-)managed, it reduces all outcomes – making efficiency gains harder, undermining reliability (effectiveness) and frustrating users (eroding trust).\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses how technology can enhance state capacity by improving data quality, coordination among agencies, and enabling proactive interventions, ultimately strengthening public trust. It emphasizes that achieving system-level efficiency in governance requires operational efficiency, enhanced state capacity, and public trust to be interrelated.

    "content": "Thus, a successful digital government must continuously pursue reduction of complicatedness and introduce principles that enable self-organization into the system. Resilience This refers to the ability of government to withstand shocks and continue operating under adverse conditions – be it cyberattacks, natural disasters or sudden surges in demand (like a pandemic). Efficiency measures must not come at the expense of resilience. Centralizing infrastructure might be short- term efficient, but it can create single points of failure; conversely, distributed systems may be more resilient but harder to govern. A resilient digital government is adaptive to changing circumstances through strategically managing supply chain risks, technology options, policies and threats so that it can perform even under extraordinary circumstances. Resilience contributes to public trust (people know services will be there in a crisis) and to state capacity (the government can manage during emergencies). Sustainability Governments must balance short-term wins with long-term sustainability. This has two aspects: financial sustainability (avoiding projects that create unsustainable maintenance costs or technical debt) and policy sustainability (ensuring that digital reforms support long-term goals like inclusiveness and environmental sustainability). Launching a system that is not maintainable, lacks public satisfaction); meanwhile, maintaining public trust requires that efficiency gains are achieved without sacrificing accountability or equity. High-performing digital governments, such as those in some EU countries, often track a portfolio of KPIs across these dimensions. Each project or policy should articulate which of these outcomes it advances and how that will be measured. For instance, a digital service project might primarily improve efficiency (faster responses) and potentially trust (better service experience), whereas a data-sharing initiative between law enforcement and courts might target effectiveness (higher conviction rates, quicker justice). Importantly, pursuing the three above mentioned outcomes is not without challenges. Four strategic concerns often shape the success or failure of digital initiatives: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. These concerns act as cross-cutting constraints or considerations: 12 Any government digitalization policy or program should be justifiable in terms of system-level efficiency outcomes (operational efficiency, state capacity, public trust) – while explicitly addressing these strategic concerns (complexity, resilience, sustainability, sovereignty). A proposal that cannot articulate how it improves at least one key outcome is likely not a good use of public resources.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of balancing efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in digital government systems. It highlights the need for governments to manage complexity, ensure resilience against shocks, and pursue long-term sustainability in digital initiatives. The document also emphasizes the importance of tracking key performance indicators to measure the success of digital projects.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Resilience in digital government involves withstanding shocks like cyberattacks and natural disasters.\n- Centralizing infrastructure can be efficient but may create single points of failure, while distributed systems offer resilience.\n- Sustainability in digital government includes financial and policy sustainability, avoiding unsustainable costs and supporting long-term goals.\n- High-performing digital governments track a portfolio of KPIs to measure efficiency, trust, and effectiveness.\n- Strategic concerns for digital initiatives include complexity, resilience, sustainability, and digital sovereignty.\n\n## Topics\nDigital government, Government resilience, Sustainability measures, Efficiency and trust, Strategic concerns",

    "content": "Likewise, if a digital initiative undermines resilience (e.g., creating a single point of failure) or sovereignty (e.g., making critical systems dependend on an unaccountable external provider), it carries hidden costs and risks that must be weighed. By using these outcomes and concerns as evaluation criteria, policymakers can have more structured debates about digital investments. Notably, pursuing all outcomes and minimizing all risks simultaneously can be challenging – there will be trade-offs. For example, maximizing operational efficiency through extreme centralization might undermine resilience or public trust. Efficiency and resilience might conflict in highly complex systems (Artime 2024), governing complex systems itself prescribes more complex guidance, evaluation and coordination systems (Schünemann et al 2024, Yang et al 2024). Therefore, finding the right balance and looking for mechanisms that achieve this through self-organization is key. The key questions then shift from what needs to be achieved to how it can be achieved. How can we move from striving for local efficiencies in a policy domain or core government function, to achieving global system-level efficiency across all government functions? Next, we turn to this question by examining a system that delivers better performance across all functions, achieves higher system efficiency than others, and at the same time manages complexity, resilience, sustainability and sovereignty — democracy. staff with the right skills or is misaligned with a wider service strategy could yield a short-term boost but undermine capacity in the long run. Similarly, focusing only on near-term KPIs might neglect crucial long-term investments (like digital literacy or legacy system modernization). Policymakers should evaluate how each technology decision affects future flexibility and costs. Sustainable digital transformation often means incremental, user-centered improvements that can be built upon, rather than one-off “silver bullets.” Digital sovereignty Means having control over one’s own systems, policies and their outcomes – including control over data, third-party risk, technical infrastructure and the rules that govern them. For a nation, this translates to balancing external technological dependencies and cost, ensuring data is stored and processed in line with national laws, and retaining the ability to change and adapt systems without being “locked in”. Digital sovereignty is linked to state capacity (a sovereign digital state can implement policy without external interference) and resilience (less risk from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical tech restrictions). It can also influence trust, as citizens may trust digital services more if they know those services are governed by their own democratic laws rather than opaque global algorithms.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the challenges and trade-offs involved in digital initiatives for government efficiency, emphasizing the importance of balancing operational efficiency with resilience, sovereignty, and public trust. It highlights the need for sustainable digital transformation through incremental improvements and the importance of digital sovereignty in maintaining control over systems and data. Policymakers are encouraged to consider long-term impacts and global system-level efficiency when making technology decisions.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Digital initiatives can create hidden costs and risks if they undermine resilience or sovereignty.\n- Maximizing operational efficiency may conflict with resilience and public trust in complex systems.\n- Digital sovereignty involves control over systems, data, and the ability to adapt without external interference.\n- Sustainable digital transformation should focus on incremental, user-centered improvements.\n- Policymakers need to evaluate technology decisions for their long-term impact on flexibility and costs.\n\n## Topics\nDigital initiatives, Government efficiency, Digital sovereignty, Sustainable transformation, Policy evaluation",

    "content": "13 Figure 1: Example of typical socio-technical tensions that governments are navigating. System-level efficiency of democracy A (whole-of-government) system-level efficiency described earlier can result from many so-called functional forms, i.e., the institutions supporting the main functions of a society, which deliver health care, education, wellbeing and other key demands and rights citizens are entitled to. What truly makes a difference is, however, how all those functions are optimized simultaneously. We argue that this can only happen in a self-organizing system when there are key principles in place which interdependently ensure that the system optimizes over all of them. As defined above, we understand system-level efficiency as something that makes sure all the functions are performed either excellently or above average in conjunction. Achieving this is certainly not easy as it should happen at the system-level. As governments modernize through information technology (including AI), they repeatedly encounter fundamental tensions in how subsystems are designed and governed. These tensions, shown in Figure 1, represent opposing principles or approaches – each with its own advantages and risks. Should we maximize control to ensure safety and force uptake of single pieces of technology, or should we rely on trust-driven exchanges and voluntary uptake of the best technology that emerges? Should we aim for full automation for efficiency or allow for human decision-making which allows for creativity and effectiveness? Do we value privacy so much that we are willing to trade it for the fairness that transparency enforces? Do we want centralized authorities for streamlined controlled processes, or do we want federated approaches which ensure this through checks and balances, mutual dependencies and market-based mechanisms? 3.2 14 The technology choices made between the opposite poles of the dimensions profoundly influence policy outcomes and the risk of societal harm or benefit. We need to be aware that technology choices made today bring downstream consequences and path dependencies that can be overcome only at great cost. Conway’s Law famously states that “any organization that designs a system will produce a design that mirrors the organization’s communication structure” (Conway 1968). In other words, the way we organize governance (centralized vs decentralized, privacy vs transparency) will be reflected in how our IT systems are structured. This means that digital government architectures, intentionally or not, end up encoding the values and structure of the government that built them.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the challenges governments face in optimizing socio-technical systems for efficiency, particularly as they modernize using information technology and AI. It highlights the tensions between different governance approaches, such as centralized versus decentralized systems, and the trade-offs between privacy and transparency. These choices impact policy outcomes and can have lasting consequences on societal structures and governance.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Governments face tensions between maximizing control and fostering trust-driven exchanges in technology adoption.\n- Decisions between full automation and human decision-making impact efficiency and creativity.\n- Trade-offs exist between privacy and transparency in government systems.\n- Centralized and decentralized governance approaches influence digital system architectures.\n- Technology choices today create path dependencies with long-term consequences.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment efficiency, Socio-technical systems, Technology adoption, Governance approaches, Privacy vs transparency",

    "content": "This also works the other way around – technological choices influence organization and governance, e.g., if we design a centralized system, it has good likelihood to produce organization structures and forms of governance that will consolidate power. This puts tremendous responsibility for people designing digital government and related policies, as in fact, they are also designing our society and form of governance. It also drives home the point that we must have clear principles guiding technology choices, rather than fixating on the technologies themselves. If we step back and look from a systems perspective, certain principles have stood the test of time in ensuring system-level efficiency by balancing these tensions. We need not look far – we are living in such a system through democratic political order. In principle almost 2,500 years old, and in its modern form a bit more than 200 years in the making, democratic systems clearly outperform other models in system-level efficiency, at least in delivering the functions people universally value. There is plenty of empirical evidence backing this up with hard numbers. Though highly centralized (authoritarian) systems might outperform democracies at some functions under specific conditions, there is overwhelming evidence that when it comes to the most crucial dimensions, such as economic wellbeing, happiness, health and education in conjunction, democracies outperform other regimes. Democracies provide better health care and higher population health levels (Patterson & Veenstra 2016, Franco et al 2004, Besley & Kudamatsu 2006, Kudamatsu 2012), democracies ensure higher welfare and happiness and lower poverty levels (Flavin 2024, Paleologou 2022, Dörffel & Freytag 2023), democracies educate their populations better and more effectively (Dahlum & Knutsen 2017, Apergis 2018, Brown 1999), democracies excel at science (Whetsell 2021) and provide higher, more sustained economic growth (Acemoglu et al 2019, Di & Huang 2023). Figure 2: As per Conway’s law, organizational structures and technological architectures mirror each other. 15 In other words, democracies are system-level efficient at higher rates than other political regimes, optimizing the use of resources and collective outputs in relation to their maximum potential. This does not mean they outperform in providing every function, but they do certainly outperform when looking at all those functions jointly.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the impact of technological choices on organizational structures and governance, emphasizing the importance of guiding principles in technology design. It argues that democratic systems, despite some limitations, generally outperform other governance models in terms of system-level efficiency, particularly in areas like economic wellbeing, health, education, and happiness. Empirical evidence supports the claim that democracies are more effective in optimizing resources and achieving collective outputs.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Technological choices can influence organizational structures and governance, potentially consolidating power in centralized systems.\n- Democratic systems are noted for their system-level efficiency, particularly in delivering universally valued functions.\n- Empirical evidence suggests democracies provide better healthcare, education, and economic growth compared to other regimes.\n- Democracies are associated with higher welfare, happiness, and lower poverty levels.\n- The document cites various studies supporting the superior performance of democracies in multiple dimensions.\n\n## Topics\nTechnological Impact, Democratic Efficiency, Governance Models, System-Level Efficiency",

    "content": "What are the core principles of a democratic system that lead to system-level efficiency? Let’s examine them briefly. Volumes have been written on what constitutes democracy and the forms it can take, but there is a consensus on certain key principles that characterize such a system: 1. Representation and participation. A democracy allows citizens to participate in decision-making either directly or through regularly elected representatives. Free and autonomous individuals can decide what’s best for themselves, and by engaging in joint direct decision-making or elections this becomes a collective will. This principle ensures that all interested parties have a say. It also reinforces the next principle, accountability. 2. Transparency and accountability. A democratic system must be transparent to ensure accountability of elected officials and appointed professionals. Accountability means there are mechanisms to hold those entrusted with power responsible for their actions. This principle ensures that those with power act in the interest of their ultimate principals: the citizens. 3. Pluralism (competition). No system is truly democratic without regular competition of ideas and actors. Competition ensures the best ideas thrive and are accepted based on merit. This principle allows innovation in the system and, through systematic trial and error, ensures that ideas with the potential to improve society are identified and adopted. 4. Subsidiarity and self-organization. A democratic system values subsidiarity, i.e., the rule that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level, allowing communities to self-organize. Self-organization allows communities and interest groups to act autonomously since they know what works best for them. It is also the ultimate efficiency rule: a self-organizing system needs low overhead (less central control) and tends to have the lowest transaction costs in interactions. 5. Checks and balances. There must be safeguards to ensure power is not concentrated unchecked, and that different institutions can limit each other’s power. Such an equilibrium ensures that abuses of power are rare and can be corrected collectively when detected. 6. Shared civic identity and social cohesion. Despite each actor and individual in the system having their own interests, there is a shared common identity (civic or national) that ensures social cohesion. This shared identity means that while we differ as individuals and groups, we play by the same set of rules as citizens, and those joint rules are valued in themselves. Together, implementing these principles ensures that the system self-optimizes at a higher level across all central government functions. The exact institutional setup might differ substantially between democracies (parliamentary vs.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines core principles of democracy that contribute to system-level efficiency, including representation, transparency, pluralism, subsidiarity, checks and balances, and shared civic identity. These principles ensure citizen participation, accountability, innovation, and social cohesion, fostering an efficient and self-optimizing democratic system. The specific institutional arrangements may vary among democracies, but these foundational principles remain consistent.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Democracy allows citizens to participate in decision-making directly or through elected representatives, ensuring representation and participation.\n- Transparency and accountability are crucial in a democracy to hold officials responsible for their actions.\n- Pluralism fosters competition of ideas, allowing the best ideas to thrive and improve society.\n- Subsidiarity supports decision-making at the lowest level, promoting self-organization and reducing transaction costs.\n- Checks and balances prevent power concentration and ensure that institutions can limit each other's power.\n\n## Topics\nDemocratic principles, System efficiency, Citizen participation, Accountability mechanisms, Social cohesion",

Similarly, the particular accountability mechanisms a society chooses are secondary to the fact that functioning accountability exists in practice. 16 Implications to digital government How are these principles relevant for digital government? The answer becomes clear by looking at them: If these principles have allowed us to build and govern complex societies while continuously improving living standards, then they must not only work well – they should be transferable and broadly applicable to yield the same effect in other contexts. In other words, when applied to designing a digital government or state information system, these principles help optimize the efficiency of the system-as-a-whole. Applying democratic principles to digital design makes the democratic system itself more resilient, effectively perpetuating democracy in the digital realm. This implies that government digitalization ultimately makes democracy stronger, because good digitalization is essentially an emulation of democracy’s core principles. Next, we argue how these democratic principles impact digital government architecture and highlight which efficiency outcome(s) each principle most strongly impacts. 3.3 17 Democratic principle Implications for digital government architecture Primary impact on Representation and participation – Government reflects the will and diversity of the people. Ensure digital accessibility for everyone regardless of their skills or impairments; design algorithms and interfaces to avoid bias and exclusion. Trust Transparency and accountability – Officials are accountable for their actions. Make systems and algorithms auditable and transparent. For example, provide public audit trails and open data on automated decisions. Clearly communicate what data the government collects, the legal basis for its use, and offer traceability and oversight for data sharing between agencies. Trust Pluralism (competition) – No monopoly of power; ideas compete on merit. Prefer open standards over monolithic proprietary solutions. Architectures should favor an ecosystem of interoperable modules with functional equivalence, avoiding any monopolistic technology structures that lock in one vendor or approach. State capacity and operational efficiency Subsidiarity and self- organization – Decisions made at the lowest effective level. Use a federated system architecture. Decentralize systems horizontally (across functions) and vertically (across levels of government), avoiding unnecessary concentration of power in a single authority. This distributed design mirrors democratic decentralization. State capacity and operational efficiency Checks and balances – Power is limited and monitored by others. Enforce segregation of duties in IT systems and data governance.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the application of democratic principles to digital government systems, emphasizing that these principles can enhance system efficiency and strengthen democracy. It argues that digital government designs should reflect democratic values such as representation, transparency, and decentralization. By doing so, digitalization not only improves government efficiency but also reinforces democratic resilience.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Democratic principles can optimize digital government systems by enhancing efficiency and resilience.\n- Digital government designs should ensure accessibility, transparency, and avoid monopolistic structures.\n- Representation and participation in digital systems require accessibility for all, avoiding bias and exclusion.\n- Transparency in digital systems involves making algorithms auditable and providing open data on decisions.\n- Decentralized system architecture mirrors democratic decentralization, enhancing state capacity and efficiency.\n\n## Topics\nDigital government, Democratic principles, System efficiency, Transparency and accountability, Decentralization",

These principles call for thoughtful alignment of governance values with system architecture – from ensuring representation through inclusive platforms, to baking in accountability through transparency features, to structuring systems in a decentralized way that mirrors distributed power. When done right, digital government will strengthen democracy, making institutions more responsive, inclusive and resilient. Figure 3: Framework to build efficient digital governments using democratic principles. The next part of this paper translates these principles into an actionable roadmap, outlining how countries at various stages of digital maturity can progress toward cyberocratic governance (governance by information) in a controlled, value-preserving way. 19 Roadmap to efficient digital democracy 4. 20 To translate these principles into practice, we can identify key stages of technology adoption in government and highlight fundamental phases and decision points that significantly affect the journey. The stages can be summarized as follows: Secure and trusted foundation for digital government Establish the base digital infrastructure: core registries and databases, unique identifiers, digital identity for citizens, secure data exchange mechanisms and other digital public infrastructure (for example, digital payment systems). This stage focuses on getting the fundamentals right and offers opportunities to significantly increase efficiency. However, it also demands foundational choices that can either solidify democratic principles or erode them. Rise of intelligence in government systems and services Once foundational systems are in place, governments turn to improving policy outcomes within specific sectors. In this stage, advanced digital governments gradually move toward citizen-centric, whole-of-government service delivery – breaking down silos between agencies so that services can be delivered seamlessly. The outcome is significantly increased effectiveness and citizen satisfaction in each major domain (health, justice, finance, etc.), as well as new policy insights from pooled data (Haug et al. 2023).\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines the importance of integrating democratic principles into digital government systems to enhance efficiency and strengthen democracy.

    "content": "In this stage, governments also encounter new choices about how to uphold democratic principles amid emerging technologies. Nations that execute this well develop a highly trusted and efficient digital government. They will prioritize data governance and have a highly developed data valuation culture, gaining new data-driven policy insights for better governance. Cyberocratic governance and the future of democracy in the age of AI At the most advanced stage, government leverages high-quality data and AI to make governance more adaptive and predictive – essentially “rule by information,” or cyberocracy (Ronfeldt & Varda 2008). Policies can be adjusted in real time based on data (while preserving human oversight), and government incorporates more direct citizen input (potentially adopting elements of direct democracy through digital tools). This stage envisions governance that is not only efficient and personalized for the citizens but also continuously participatory – a blend of data-driven administration (OECD 2019) with active civic engagement, all under strong rule-of-law frameworks and technologically realized citizen control. Governments entering the cyberocratic era face a crucial fork: will their digital state evolve as a digital democracy or veer into digital autocracy? In the following sections, we look at these stages in more detail, examining the choices and implications at each stage. 01. 02. 03. 21 Secure and trusted foundation to digital government 4.1.1. Base registries and the once-only principle Base registries are authoritative public databases that serve as the single source of truth for core information about persons, organizations, assets and locations. They underpin efficient governance and service delivery by providing legal legitimacy to records (acting as trust anchors for data on individuals, businesses, properties, etc.). Because many services rely on these foundational datasets, base registries must be high- quality and broadly accessible (European Commission 2018). This prevents each agency from keeping its own redundant records – such as parallel lists of citizens or companies – and ensures all parts of government use a shared, trusted source. Crucially, base registries should be kept institutionally and legally separate to maintain proper checks and balances. Consolidating all vital data under one authority will inevitably lead to mission creep. Instead, different ministries or agencies each manage a different registry. Data sharing between them is permitted only when necessary and under clear legal rules. Many countries embed such rules in law (stipulating which authorities can access which data and for what purpose) and establish secure data- exchange systems accordingly.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the evolution of digital governance, emphasizing the importance of data governance and the potential of AI to create a cyberocratic government that is adaptive and participatory. It highlights the role of base registries as foundational elements in digital governance, ensuring efficient service delivery and maintaining legal legitimacy. The text also explores the critical choice governments face between evolving into digital democracies or digital autocracies.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Governments must prioritize data governance to develop efficient digital systems.\n- Cyberocracy involves using AI for adaptive and predictive governance, blending data-driven administration with civic engagement.\n- Base registries serve as authoritative databases for core information, ensuring efficient governance.\n- Base registries must remain institutionally separate to prevent mission creep and maintain checks and balances.\n- Governments face a choice between evolving into digital democracies or digital autocracies.\n\n## Topics\nDigital governance, Data governance, AI in government, Base registries, Digital democracy",

    "content": "For example, Estonia designates certain registries as official sources and requires all agencies to use them rather than collect data anew. This federated model prevents undue concentration of power and mission creep (even if unintentional). Federation can occur both horizontally and vertically – systems can be federated across functions (e.g., separate population and commercial registries) and across levels of government (local/ municipal, regional/state, federal). This also reinforces the democratic principles of self-organization and subsidiarity. Because base registries are widely used, data quality must be rigorously managed – any error can quickly spread across services. For this reason, base registries are often best operated by organizations that provide public services related to those registries, allowing data to be corrected as part of natural business operations. This approach also reduces complexity and improves sustainability. Federation of registries and systems further increases resilience – if executed well, failures or risks in one system do not necessarily propagate to others, improving the security and reliability of the entire digital government. Another important design goal is to minimize the number of different identification numbers in use across government. Ideally, each person has one unique personal ID, and each company has one unique business ID, used for all interactions with public services. Wherever possible, governments aim to implement unified identifiers. Estonia, for example, uses one national ID number for nearly all services. If a single ID scheme is not feasible, interoperability strategies can cross-reference multiple IDs for the same person or entity. Notably, basic identifiers like a national ID code or business registration number 4.1 22 should be treated as non-secret public information to facilitate verification, whereas the personal data associated with those IDs remains protected. Simply knowing someone’s ID number must not compromise their privacy, because any access to the actual personal records still requires proper authentication through the secure digital identity system. Interconnecting base registries is a foundational step toward true digital government. They provide common identifiers and reference data that all other systems can rely on. This dramatically boosts efficiency and improves public satisfaction by reducing repetitive paperwork. Once information is recorded in a base registry, government services can retrieve and reuse it whenever needed, rather than repeatedly asking citizens to supply the same details. Reusing data in this way also builds trust, as people see that the government is not continually asking for information it already has.\n\n---\n## Summary\nEstonia's digital government model emphasizes the use of federated base registries to prevent data redundancy and enhance efficiency. By using unique identifiers for individuals and businesses, Estonia ensures seamless interaction with public services while maintaining privacy through secure digital identity systems. This approach increases system resilience, reduces complexity, and builds public trust by minimizing repetitive data requests.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Estonia uses federated base registries to prevent data redundancy and improve government efficiency.\n- Unique personal and business IDs are used for all public service interactions in Estonia.\n- Base registries in Estonia are operated by public service organizations to ensure data quality.\n- Interconnected base registries enhance system resilience and security in digital government.\n- Estonia's model builds public trust by reducing repetitive data requests and protecting privacy.\n\n## Topics\nDigital government, Data management, Public services, Identity systems, Government efficiency",

    "content": "This practice of reusing information is known as the once-only principle – citizens and businesses should have to provide standard information only once, after which government systems share it internally (with necessary consent or legal authority) instead of asking again. The once-only principle in practice hinges on the availability of comprehensive and trusted base registries. If those registries exist and are kept accurate, any government agency can query them to obtain needed information instead of bothering the citizen. For example, when someone applies for a pension, the system can automatically pull the person’s birth date and identity details from the national population register (instead of requiring a birth certificate), check employment history from tax or social security records, verify the current address from the address register and so forth. All of this happens behind the scenes without the individual having to resubmit data that the government already holds. When each component is interoperable, such end-to- end services become seamless and largely automatic, significantly improving the user experience. Progress toward these foundational goals can be measured with clear success metrics. One key indicator is a reduction in duplicate data requests to citizens. For instance, Estonia tracks how many times data are shared between systems instead of asking a citizen to provide it; each such instance is counted as an application of the once-only principle, and a steadily rising count signals improvement. Another indicator is the adoption of common data standards and classifications across government (so that all agencies are “speaking the same language” when referring to countries, regions, businesses, medical terms and so on.). Investing early in shared code lists and taxonomies – such as a master list of government agencies with unique identifiers – pays off later by simplifying integrations and reducing errors. Next, we look at digital public infrastructure, which enables the once-only principle and other efficiencies. 23 4.1.2. National digital public infrastructure Practically implementing the once-only principle requires using data across government via secure infrastructure. Every interaction between systems must be trusted. It must be clear who is requesting or updating data, that the exchange is legally permitted, and that no unauthorized changes or leaks occur. Addressing these trust and security requirements is the role of digital public infrastructure (DPI). If implemented correctly, DPI also forms the first and most important layer of cyber defense (in effect implementing a nationwide zero-trust architecture), significantly lowering cybersecurity threats and costs across the public sector.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe once-only principle aims to improve government efficiency by ensuring citizens and businesses provide standard information only once, with government systems sharing it internally thereafter. This principle relies on comprehensive base registries and secure digital public infrastructure to facilitate seamless data sharing and reduce duplicate data requests. Implementing such systems can enhance user experience and cybersecurity while lowering costs.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The once-only principle reduces duplicate data requests by sharing information internally within government systems.\n- Comprehensive and trusted base registries are essential for the once-only principle to function effectively.\n- Estonia measures progress by tracking how often data is shared between systems instead of being requested from citizens.\n- Common data standards and classifications across government agencies are crucial for seamless data integration.\n- Digital public infrastructure is key to secure data sharing and forms a layer of cyber defense.\n\n## Topics\nOnce-only principle, Government efficiency, Digital infrastructure, Data sharing, Cybersecurity",

    "content": "Core components of a secure and trusted DPI include: Digital identity and e-signatures A high-assurance digital identity and e-signature system for all residents (as well as for legal entities and even government systems) is fundamental to providing government services online in a legally binding way. This must be backed by laws that recognize digital identity and signatures as equivalent to physical ones. Together, these enable the elimination of most paper documents and credentials, paving the way for significant efficiency gains across the entire economy. For example, Estonia’s government calculates that digital identity and e-signatures save at least 2% of GDP annually. The design choices for digital identity have a paramount impact on society: with proper checks and balances (a design where the citizen controls the use of their identity), digital identity can enable significant efficiency gains that fuel further trust. However, if the system identifies citizens without giving them control (e.g., using pervasive biometrics without consent), it invites abuse; a system without strong safeguards will eventually erode effectiveness and outcomes. Federated data exchange system A federated, real-time data exchange network that links information systems in a secure way. Through this exchange layer, data remain in their original source systems and are provided to others on demand, transaction by transaction. All data requests and transfers should be end-to-end encrypted and authenticated, meaning only authorized systems and users can retrieve certain data (with full auditability for accountability and transparency). Domain-specific data exchange networks (e.g., for e-payments or e-invoicing) also fall in this category. A globally notable example is the X-Road platform for secure government interoperability – enabling data exchange horizontally (across agencies), vertically (across levels of government) and even across borders. Data wallets and verifiable credentials In addition to system-to-system real-time data exchanges, personal data wallets provide an alternative way for individuals to hold and selectively use their own verified credentials. For instance, instead of an employer having to verify an applicant’s degree via a government database, the applicant could directly share a verifiable digital diploma from their personal data wallet. These wallets give users more control over their information and offer an alternative channel for data exchange – useful if automated interoperability between systems is unavailable or undesired. Personal data wallets embody principles of participation, subsidiarity and resilience by giving citizens more personal control over their data and reducing dependence on central systems. 24 Single digital gateways One-stop-shop portals or applications that provide a unified front door to government services.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of secure and trusted digital public infrastructure (DPI) components like digital identity, e-signatures, and federated data exchange systems for enhancing government efficiency.

    "content": "A single digital gateway (often implemented as a government one-stop-shop or a mobile “super-app”) allows users to access a wide range of services from different agencies through one consistent interface. These gateways might operate at the national level or be specialized by sector or region, but in all cases, they simplify user interactions by aggregating services on one platform. Single digital gateways implement the principles of shared civic identity and participation. They do, however, need to balance choices between centralization and federation to provide the best service experience without concentrating too much control. Sovereign clouds These are cloud computing environments for government or public use that ensure government control over computing and data. Importantly, a sovereign cloud strategy should avoid concentrating risk in a single cloud provider. Instead, a system of clouds (potentially a mix of private and public clouds meeting sovereign requirements) can improve resilience, strengthen digital sovereignty and enhance cost-efficiency for digital government – especially if competitiveness principles are included (avoiding vendor lock-in and encouraging multiple solutions). All these components work in concert toward the same goal: delivering efficient digital services in a secure and trusted manner. In effect, the digital infrastructure must serve as both an enabler and a gatekeeper for digital government. It enables seamless data flows and service automation, while simultaneously acting as a gatekeeper that enforces privacy, security and proper use of data. International initiatives such as the UN’s DPI Safeguards provide comprehensive guidance on built-in safeguards for such infrastructure. It is also important how DPI itself is organized and provided. DPI should enable effective digital government functions while avoiding a new concentration of power and control. In other words, DPI itself must not become a single, monolithic system – it should remain competitive and modular. DPI must allow incorporation and interoperability of different systems and technologies through common standards, rather than enforcing a single technology solution. For example, instead of mandating one specific digital identity solution or one “sovereign cloud” technical stack, government should provide interoperable standards and institutional mechanisms to procure and operate multiple competing solutions from public or private sectors. This approach upholds the principles of participation, competition and self- organization – fundamental drivers of both democracy and overall government efficiency. 25 4.1.3. Transparency and public trust in personal data usage No matter how advanced the technology, a digital government can only function with the consent and confidence of its people. Thus, the trustworthiness of the digital public infrastructure itself must be beyond reproach.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the implementation of single digital gateways and sovereign clouds to enhance government efficiency by providing a unified platform for accessing various services.

    "content": "One way to bolster public trust is to build transparency and personal control into data practices by giving each citizen a clear view of, and control over, how their data are used by the government – a sort of accessible “digital twin” of the citizen’s government- held identity and records. This can be provided through a dedicated public service or portal. Through such a service, individuals can see which government agencies have accessed their personal data, what data were accessed and when. They can also review what information is on file about themselves and, in some cases, correct any inaccuracies. Estonia’s national e-portal and government mobile app, for instance, include a Personal Data Tracker tool that lets residents see every query made on their personal records. This level of transparency is now seen as vital to maintaining public trust in government data use. Empowering citizens in this way creates a virtuous cycle linking transparency, trust and better outcomes. When people have real-time insight and control over their data, they are more likely to trust digital services. Greater trust leads to higher adoption and use of e-services, which in turn boosts administrative efficiency and compliance – since more interactions flow through streamlined digital channels and citizens are more likely to provide accurate information. Transparency breeds further trust: it drives uptake and cooperation, generates more data for improvements and thereby reinforces trust. This, in sum, is the social contract of digital government – citizens are willing to allow the use of personal data in return for efficient service outcomes, as long as they have visibility and agency in that exchange. Figure 4: Personal data tracker in a government super app. 26 A telling measure of a nation’s digital public infrastructure – and the trust it has built – is whether core democratic exercises, such as general elections, can be conducted online securely and with high public confidence. Secure internet-based voting for national elections remains rare globally, but Estonia has successfully provided it at scale. Estonia first introduced nationwide online voting in 2005, leveraging its advanced digital identity and data exchange infrastructure to authenticate voters and protect the integrity of the ballot. Thanks to the robust design of its DPI, the system has never been compromised, even though Estonia has been a major target of nation-scale cyberattacks since 2007. The constant external threats have, in fact, been a key driver for building high resilience and security into the system.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of transparency and personal control in government data practices to build public trust.

    "content": "By 2023, the popularity of the online voting had grown to the point that more than 50% of all votes in Estonia’s parliamentary elections were cast online – exceeding the number of paper ballots for the first time. This outcome reflects a remarkable level of public trust in the country’s digital government systems. Few other countries have ventured to implement internet voting on a large scale, precisely because the security and transparency requirements are so stringent. To be viable, an e-voting system must ensure end-to-end integrity: every step from voter authentication and authorization to ballot submission, encryption, secure storage and accurate tallying of votes must be protected and verifiable. Strict oversight is essential – independent audits and verification mechanisms must ensure results are credible. Estonia’s experience suggests that when a digital ecosystem is mature and citizens have seen its benefits over many years, they are more willing to accept even fundamental civic processes going online. The benefits of online voting include greater democratic accessibility and participation (citizens can cast their vote securely from anywhere) and potentially higher turnout. At the same time, a parallel paper voting option is maintained to ensure inclusivity and public confidence for those less comfortable with digital methods. With strong online voting practice in place and with wide adoption, democratic processes can be conducted more cost-effectively and more frequently. This not only reinforces democratic practices but also enables new forms of civil participations, which we analyze further in later chapters. By implementing these foundational elements, governments establish an efficient and trusted base for digital government while also reinforcing democracy. Even nations at an early digital stage can leapfrog by focusing on these fundamentals. With a secure foundation in place, governments can next turn to leveraging shared data and emerging technologies (such as AI) to further transform public service delivery and outcomes. Case study: Online voting as a benchmark for trust and resilience in digital public infrastructure 27 Rise of intelligence in government systems and services With strong digital government foundations and safeguards in place, governments can shift focus to improving domain-specific outcomes. This next stage moves beyond digitalizing siloed services – agencies begin to collaborate across traditional boundaries to deliver integrated, citizen-centric services. In this stage, the information networks and data flows within government systems begin to rise in intelligence. We see both vertical integration within sectors (connecting all key actors in, for example, the healthcare or justice sector) and horizontal integration across related sectors (for example, linking social services with employment services, since outcomes in one affect the other).\n\n---\n## Summary\nBy 2023, Estonia achieved a milestone where over 50% of votes in parliamentary elections were cast online, demonstrating high public trust in digital government systems.

    "content": "The result is more proactive, personalized services in each domain, improved efficiency and outcome metrics (e.g., faster case resolution in justice or better care coordination in health) and a richer pool of information for policy insights within each domain. This in turn leads to higher overall government efficiency. However, in this stage, governments also start to navigate difficult choices about how new data flows challenge old institutional structures, and they must balance short-term gains with long-term governance principles. 4.2.1. Government information systems and super-domains National information ecosystems consist of the networks, standards and organizations that enable data and information to flow seamlessly across government, businesses and society. At this stage, each major policy domain (justice, health, public finance, education, social protection, transportation, land use, etc.) becomes a digitally coherent environment where data, information, and knowledge flow seamlessly among relevant actors in real time. The primary purpose of these integrated ecosystems is to improve sector-specific outcomes. Below are some examples of domain-specific national information ecosystems, the key entities involved, and the benefits achieved: 4.2 28 Integrates data across police, prosecutors, courts, prisons, probation services and even victim support organizations. This connectivity enables faster, fairer justice. Links hospitals, primary care clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, emergency medical services and health insurers/national health funds. The outcome is better patient results and efficiency. Connects tax authorities, customs, the statistics office, social security administration, banks, business registries. This yields higher revenue collection and efficiency, and less administrative burden for entrepreneurs. Richer real-time economic data becomes available for better- informed policymaking. Brings together local planning offices, cadastre and land registries, building regulators, environmental agencies and utilities. The result is quicker permits and smarter development. A unified digital permitting portal and shared land data make approval processes faster and decisions more informed and transparent. Speeding up permits accelerates housing construction and infrastructure projects, boosting economic activity. Integrates social benefit agencies, public employment services, education/training providers, child protection agencies. This enables faster service delivery and improves social outcomes. Links 911/112 emergency call centers with police, fire departments, ambulance services, disaster management agencies and even sensor networks (e.g., weather or earthquake sensors). The result is improved emergency response. Connects intelligence agencies, law enforcement, border control, cybersecurity centers and international intelligence partners.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses how integrated national information ecosystems across various policy domains can enhance government efficiency by enabling seamless data flow and improving sector-specific outcomes.

Justice (criminal justice chain) Healthcare Public finance and real-time economy Land and urban planning Social services Public safety and emergency response Security and intelligence (national security) 29 Each example shows how integrating data and processes within a domain translates into improved outcomes – faster justice, better health or greater safety. Each step up the maturity ladder brings greater efficiency and effectiveness, which in turn enables more advanced and citizen-focused service delivery in these domains. Achieving a high-maturity information exchange requires progressing from basic, context-agnostic data sharing (basic interoperability that aims to achieve once-only data-sharing between registers) to rich, context-aware information sharing and ultimately knowledge exchange. At each stage, the depth of interoperability increases – common semantic standards (such as shared taxonomies and ontologies) ensure that data is not only transmitted but also understood in context. In essence, standards serve as a common language, allowing different systems and organizations to exchange data meaningfully rather than just technically. As the ecosystem matures, stakeholders adopt common data standards and models so that information carries explicit meaning across systems. Here, data exchange becomes true information exchange – data are augmented with standard definitions and metadata that make their context understandable to any authorized receiver. This is achieved by implementing shared taxonomies or data dictionaries that define each data element consistently across the domain. Using standardized taxonomies makes data self-describing, enabling semantic interoperability within that domain (the data’s meaning is preserved across systems). Many domain-specific standards emerge at this stage. For example, in healthcare the HL7/FHIR standards define common formats and codes for exchanging patient records, lab results, medications, etc., so all hospitals and clinics interpret the data the same way. In finance, the XBRL standard allows businesses and regulators to share financial reports with a common understanding. By using such standards and taxonomies, there is far less need for manual data mapping or guesswork – the meaning itself “travels” with the data. The most advanced stage moves beyond exchanging structured information into exchanging knowledge (semantic interoperability with ontologies). At this maturity level, government information systems don’t just share data with agreed meanings; they integrate reasoning, relationships and insights derived from that information. Multiple taxonomies can be linked under a common ontology – effectively uniting various domain vocabularies into an interoperable whole.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of integrating data and processes across various domains to improve outcomes in areas like justice, healthcare, and public safety.

    "content": "For example, an ontology might incorporate a healthcare taxonomy, a pharmaceuticals taxonomy and a geographic taxonomy, enabling knowledge to be shared meaningfully across medicine and location (such as tracking a disease outbreak by place). This enables parties to ask complex questions or discover insights that weren’t possible at the basic information level. An ontology provides a shared context model that computers can use to infer new information and ensure unambiguous interpretation across domains. While a taxonomy might list and categorize, say, medical terms or legal concepts, an ontology describes how those concepts relate (e.g., understanding that Diabetes is a type of Chronic Disease, so if a patient has diabetes, the system can infer that the patient has a chronic condition even if not explicitly stated). Knowledge exchange is enabled by technologies like knowledge graphs, reasoning engines and linked data standards. A well-known example is the Google Knowledge Graph, which aggregates facts about people, places and things from many sources and uses 30 ontologies to integrate multiple taxonomies and data feeds into a cohesive graph of knowledge. This allows, for instance, a query that spans domains or infers relationships across datasets. Generally, ontologies and knowledge graphs act as a “contract for meaning” so that all parties share the same understanding of concepts and relationships. Together, they enable a knowledge-driven information ecosystem or super- domain where machines can understand context, detect patterns and even draw basic inferences from shared data. Crucially, each step up this maturity ladder brings greater efficiency and intelligence to the ecosystem. Higher semantic interoperability means less ambiguity, less manual intervention and more reuse of data and services across government. It also helps to reduce complexity and makes decisions more understandable and transparent, which invites more participation and oversight. At each stage, the depth of interoperability increases – data is not only transmitted, but understood in context. 31 4.2.2. New public service delivery models and institutional reforms Having richer information flows and stronger interoperability opens the door to fundamentally improved public service delivery models. As digital public infrastructure and standards mature, governments have been moving beyond basic transactional e-government portals toward services that are personalized, proactive and citizen-centric. Rather than forcing people to navigate complex bureaucratic structures, the idea is for government to assemble what each person needs, when they need it, across organizational boundaries. Service delivery is evolving to become anticipatory and seamlessly integrated into citizens’ lives. For many years, a flagship approach to this vision has been the “life-event” service model.\n\n---\n## Summary\nOntologies and knowledge graphs enhance data interoperability by providing a shared context for understanding complex relationships across domains, leading to more efficient and intelligent ecosystems. This advancement allows governments to improve public service delivery models, making them more personalized and citizen-centric.

    "content": "Life-event services (for example, “Having a child,” “Starting a business” or “Retirement”) bundle multiple agencies’ services and requirements into one unified, end-to- end journey for the user. Done well, life-event services eliminate duplicate data requests (honoring the once- only principle so that citizens don’t have to provide the same information twice), reduce the time to achieve an outcome, and build public trust through a more user-friendly experience. In principle, a citizen entering a life-event portal provides their information once, and the government handles the behind-the-scenes coordination across departments. However, implementing real life-event services (not just describing how they work, but integrating all these digital services into a unified whole) has proven notoriously difficult. It requires intense cross- agency governance and cooperation: clarity on who “owns” the service or life-event process, agreements on shared funding and service-level agreements, harmonization of rules and processes across agencies, and often new legal bases for data sharing. Many ambitious life-event programs have stalled not due to technology, but because of institutional and policy frictions – agencies may struggle to agree on responsibilities, funding or data-sharing rules. The coordination overhead is high, and negotiating every detail of a complex life-event can take years. This opens the door to a key policy choice for mature digital governments: now that we have data flows that do not neatly follow traditional institutional structures, should we rethink institutional boundaries and structures for efficiency? Many institutional reforms, such as merging tax and customs administrations for better coordination on VAT and excise taxes, are linked to efficiency gains. However, proper checks Now that we have data flows that do not neatly follow traditional institutional structures, should we rethink institutional boundaries and structures for efficiency? 32 Figure 5: Self-organizing, agent-driven and proactive services in a government super app. and balances are crucial to ensure that in pursuing efficiency we do not unnecessarily consolidate power in ways that undermine democratic principles or public trust. An alternative route – one better aligned with the democratic principles of subsidiarity and decentralization – is now emerging as self-organizing services with agentic-driven AI. In this model, instead of pre-defining every cross-agency service bundle and assigning a single agency “owner,” the government focuses on exposing secure, standardized capabilities as APIs (for example: verify identity, check eligibility, fetch a citizen’s civil status, validate a permit, issue a payment or schedule an appointment).\n\n---\n## Summary\nLife-event services aim to streamline government processes by bundling multiple agencies' services into a single, user-friendly journey, reducing redundant data requests and building public trust. However, implementing these services is challenging due to institutional and policy frictions, requiring significant cross-agency cooperation and governance. An emerging alternative is self-organizing services using agent-driven AI, which focuses on secure, standardized APIs rather than rigid service bundles.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Life-event services bundle multiple agencies' services into a unified journey for users.\n- Implementing life-event services requires intense cross-agency governance and cooperation.\n- Institutional and policy frictions often stall life-event programs, not technology limitations.\n- Self-organizing services with agent-driven AI offer an alternative to traditional service bundles.\n- Standardized APIs are central to the emerging model of self-organizing government services.\n\n## Topics\nLife-event services, Government efficiency, Cross-agency cooperation, Agent-driven AI, Standardized APIs",

    "content": "This approach shifts the burden of integration from the institutional layer to the service layer. Instead of agencies needing to negotiate upfront who owns an entire life-event process, agencies simply agree to provide certain capabilities under common standards and governance. The agentic service layer – which could manifest as a government super-app, a digital assistant or third-party apps – stitches together the necessary steps in real time. The outcome for the citizen is the same or better level of personalization, proactivity and convenience that a life-event service would promise but achieved with fewer structural bottlenecks behind the scenes. Essentially, the user interacts with one smart interface that can handle many tasks proactively. To enable self-organizing, agent-driven services at scale, governments must have robust digital infrastructure and standards in place. Key enablers 33 include high-quality authoritative data, common data models, and semantic interoperability across agencies (so that an agent can understand and use information from multiple sources). Equally important are well- defined service APIs for core functions, available for trusted internal or external use and an event-driven architecture that allows systems to react to changes in real time (for example, a change in a citizen’s status automatically triggers relevant updates or services). With self-organized services, services become significantly more proactive and adaptive. Instead of reactive, one-size-fits-all processes, the government can deliver support that is tailored and timely for each individual’s context. For government organizations, the focus shifts to owning and excelling in capabilities – ensuring high-quality data, reliable APIs and clear rules encoded as software – rather than trying to manage every possible end-to-end customer journey themselves. Cross-agency agreements and governance also evolve: the question is no longer “Who owns this entire life-event service?” but “Who ensures that each underlying capability is delivered reliably and securely?” Each agency or product team takes responsibility for the performance of the capabilities it provides, treating them as critical products. Oversight bodies and regulators, in turn, focus on the outcomes and ensure that when AI agents are involved, they operate transparently, safely and without bias. For instance, audits shift to examining how an AI agent used data and why it made certain decisions on a citizen’s behalf, rather than evaluating only human case handling. All this builds upon the concept of government-as- a-platform: the government provides foundational building blocks and various service providers or even intelligent agents can innovate on top of them.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses a shift in government service delivery from an institutional to a service layer, enabling more personalized and proactive citizen interactions through a smart interface. This approach requires robust digital infrastructure, including high-quality data, common standards, and semantic interoperability.

    "content": "For example, a private-sector company might build a more user-friendly mobile interface for a government service or personal digital assistants could interact with government APIs to get things done for users – all within the policy and security frameworks set by government. Self-organizing, agentic public services are a prime example of using the right technology in the right way to deliver public value and improve efficiency. Next, we further analyze the use of AI in government and how it can enhance efficiency when applied responsibly. 34 Service model Service logic Citizen effort Strengths Limits Traditional digital services Citizen initiates separate applications per agency; point-to- point workflows. Medium. The citizen must search, re-enter data and repeat submissions (still better than physical paperwork or phone calls). Simple to build and manage; low coordination costs between agencies. Fragmented experience; duplicate data entry; slower outcomes; risk of exclusion for some users. Proactive services Government initiates service based on known events/data (e.g., a benefit offer triggered by a life event). Very low. Citizen only needs to confirm and consent, if anything. Inclusive and fast; builds trust; once- only principle fully applied within scope. Limited to well- defined events; requires solid legal bases and very accurate data. Life-event service bundles Pre-designed end-to-end journeys for major life events. Low. A single entry point and bundled steps for the user. Holistic, intuitive service; measures outcomes across agencies. Hard to scale across all life events; high institutional coordination needed; disputes over ownership and funding. Self- organizing agentic services AI agents compose capabilities dynamically per context and can be conversational or event-driven. Potentially lowest. Largely assistive (prefilled, guided interactions; the citizen can opt out if desired). Highly personalized and adaptive; spans multiple domains; avoids many institutional bottlenecks. Requires very mature DPI and standards; transparency, bias mitigation and safety must be engineered by design. Table 2: Comparison of public service delivery models – traditional digital services, proactive services, life-event bundles and self-organizing agentic services. 35 Rule-based (deterministic) automation applies predefined logic to well-structured inputs and will, given the same conditions, always produce the same outcome. If the rules and data inputs are known and complete, the process is entirely predictable. This predictability makes rule-based systems transparent and straightforward to audit, because one can trace every decision to an explicit rule or law.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the integration of technology in government services to enhance efficiency and public value. It compares different service delivery models such as traditional digital services, proactive services, life-event service bundles, and self-organizing agentic services, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The role of AI and rule-based automation in improving government efficiency is also analyzed.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Self-organizing agentic services use AI to dynamically compose capabilities based on context.\n- Proactive services are initiated by the government based on known events or data, requiring minimal citizen effort.\n- Life-event service bundles provide a single entry point for major life events, offering holistic service delivery.\n- Traditional digital services require citizens to initiate separate applications per agency, leading to a fragmented experience.\n- Rule-based automation applies predefined logic to structured inputs, ensuring predictable and auditable outcomes.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment efficiency, Service delivery models, AI in government, Rule-based automation, Public service technology",

    "content": "In essence, these systems encode the application of policy or legislation into software. They excel at tasks that are repetitive, standardized and grounded in clear criteria. AI or machine learning (non-deterministic) automation involves systems that learn patterns from data (including unstructured or incomplete data like free-text documents, images or sensor feeds) and make probabilistic inferences or predictions. Rather than following fixed if- then rules, AI models recognize complex patterns and correlations to estimate outcomes (e.g., the likelihood of fraud, the classification of a document, a prediction of service demand). This is valuable when not all decision criteria can be exhaustively specified in advance, or when the volume of data to analyze is massive. AI systems can adapt and improve as they process more data, but their decision logic is implicit in the model and not a simple set of human-readable rules. 4.2.3. Automation in government: deterministic vs. AI systems Technology should always serve outcomes, not the other way around. As emphasized earlier, no tool – AI included – should be adopted for its own sake. The case for deploying any advanced automation must rest on clearly defined problems to be solved and measurable public value to be gained, balanced against well-understood risks (such as bias, opacity or erosion of privacy). In this context, government leaders should view artificial intelligence as one part of a broad automation toolkit, to be used only where appropriate and effective. Government agencies can draw on a spectrum of automation approaches ranging from deterministic, rule-based systems to non-deterministic AI systems. The difference lies in how each handles information and reaches decisions: 01. 02. 36 In government – which fundamentally operates based on laws and rules – deterministic automation should remain the first priority wherever possible. Rule-based systems are the right choice wherever processes are well-understood, repetitive and clearly defined by legislation or policy. Examples include calculating eligibility for benefits using established formulas, performing routine financial reconciliations, processing standard permit applications or integrating records between systems. In these cases, data can be structured and decision logic explicitly defined and explained when needed. Rule-based automation delivers speed and accuracy at scale, ensures consistency (equal treatment under the same rules) and is inherently auditable. In effect, it allows government to execute laws and policies quickly and reliably through digital systems. AI, on the other hand, is most useful in situations where tasks cannot be fully specified upfront or involve recognition of complex patterns beyond human capacity.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the application of automation in government, emphasizing the distinction between deterministic, rule-based systems and non-deterministic AI systems. Deterministic systems are preferred for tasks grounded in clear criteria, while AI is valuable for complex pattern recognition where decision criteria cannot be exhaustively specified. The document stresses that technology should serve specific outcomes and be adopted based on clearly defined problems and measurable public value.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Deterministic systems are preferred for government tasks that are repetitive and clearly defined by legislation.\n- AI systems are useful for recognizing complex patterns and making probabilistic predictions.\n- Automation in government should focus on delivering measurable public value and addressing clearly defined problems.\n- Rule-based automation ensures consistency and is inherently auditable, making it suitable for executing laws and policies.\n- AI should be used in government only where it is appropriate and effective, considering risks like bias and privacy erosion.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment automation, Deterministic systems, AI applications, Public sector technology, Policy implementation",

    "content": "This includes scenarios like detecting anomalies or fraud across millions of transactions, analyzing unstructured data (scanning vast numbers of documents, emails or images for relevant information), or providing predictive analytics and decision support. For example, AI might be used to triage cases in a social services or justice system to prioritize those needing urgent attention, or to forecast public health or social care needs. In such settings, AI’s value is not just doing things faster – it can enable entirely new capabilities that were not feasible with manual or rules-based methods alone. For instance, an AI model might analyze thousands of benefit applications and automatically approve the simple, low-risk cases (with explanations logged), freeing up human caseworkers to focus on more complex ones. Or a machine learning system could monitor real-time data from city infrastructure to predict and prevent failures before they happen. These are tasks where a static set of rules either cannot be written to cover all nuances or would be too rigid to adapt to new patterns. Both rule-based and AI-driven approaches can significantly improve performance, but in different ways. Rule-based deterministic automation streamlines well-defined processes – for example, compressing a task that once took a clerk 30 minutes into a few seconds of automated processing, and doing so with near-zero error rate. Multiplied across thousands of transactions, the time and cost savings are enormous, and every decision can be traced back to a clear rule (maintaining transparency). AI, by contrast, removes analytical bottlenecks – it can review millions of records or continuous data streams far faster than any team of human analysts, surfacing risks or insights (fraud patterns, public health trends, etc.) that neither rules nor humans might catch in time. Used well, AI augments human decision-making and enables earlier, better-targeted interventions, whether it’s preventing waste and abuse or delivering services to those who will benefit most. However, efficiency and innovation must not come at the expense of legitimacy and public trust. If an AI system’s decision process cannot be explained or audited, it should not be deployed at scale in government services without a human in the loop. This is not more than we ask from human public servants – freedom in action with transparency and adherence to regulations, or strict supervision. In areas where AI is necessary to achieve effectiveness (because no other solution can reasonably handle the complexity or volume), governments must secure transparency and accountability through other means.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the application of AI in government services, highlighting its ability to handle complex tasks like fraud detection and predictive analytics, which are beyond the scope of manual or rule-based methods. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining transparency and public trust when deploying AI systems, suggesting that AI should augment human decision-making rather than replace it entirely. Ensuring accountability and explainability in AI processes is crucial, especially in government settings.\n\n## Key Facts\n- AI can triage cases in social services to prioritize urgent attention.\n- AI models can automatically approve low-risk benefit applications, freeing human workers for complex cases.\n- Machine learning can predict and prevent city infrastructure failures using real-time data.\n- Rule-based automation can compress tasks from 30 minutes to seconds with near-zero error rates.\n- AI should not be deployed at scale in government without transparency and human oversight.\n\n## Topics\nAI in government, Predictive analytics, Fraud detection, Public trust, Automation benefits",

    "content": "This includes adopting a human-in-the-loop design for important decisions – ensuring that human officials remain responsible for final judgments that affect individuals’ 37 rights or entitlements, and that they can override or question the AI’s suggestions. Clear boundaries should be established delineating where an AI may assist or prioritize cases and where only rule-based or human decision-making will apply (especially for decisions with legal or ethical consequences). Moreover, operational transparency is critical: government authorities must document their AI models, data sources and validation processes; log the AI’s actions and recommendations; and be prepared to provide meaningful explanations to both citizens and auditors about how a decision was made. This might also mean providing an audit trail that shows which data influenced an AI recommendation or giving an individual a simplified explanation for why they were flagged by an algorithm. Governments can capture the benefits of both traditional automation and AI while upholding democratic values by applying the right tool to the right problem. Deterministic, rule-based automation should be used to encode the transparent application of law and policy wherever data is well-structured and rules are clear. This not only speeds up current services but also reinforces fairness and accountability. AI should be deployed judiciously – only where it genuinely adds value, such as making sense of patterns in large, unstructured datasets or adapting to new trends – and always within a framework of human oversight, auditability and privacy protection. The success of this stage (enhanced intelligence in services) becomes visible to citizens in everyday life: quicker services, fewer forms to fill out and a sense that the government knows them and helps them without endless red tape. It also sets the stage for the next evolution: leveraging real-time data and AI not just to improve services, but to transform governance itself into a more adaptive, responsive system – the realm of cyberocratic governance. 38 Future of democracy in the age of AI With data and information increasingly available and accessible for strategic policymaking and operational decision-making, we are approaching the limits of our current governance model. The vision of evidence-informed, adaptive governance is encapsulated in the idea of cyberocracy (Ronfeldt & Varda 2008) – a system where governance is deeply integrated with real-time data and algorithmic tools. The key distinction between democratic cyberocracy and digital authoritarianism lies in whether democratic values and public accountability to guide the use of these technologies.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the integration of AI in government decision-making, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and transparency. It argues for a balanced approach where AI aids in processing large datasets, while deterministic automation ensures fairness and accountability in well-structured scenarios. The ultimate goal is to transition towards a cyberocratic governance model that enhances democracy through real-time data and algorithmic tools.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Human oversight is crucial in AI-assisted government decision-making to ensure accountability.\n- Operational transparency requires documenting AI models, data sources, and validation processes.\n- Deterministic automation should be used where data is well-structured and rules are clear.\n- AI should be applied judiciously, particularly for analyzing large, unstructured datasets.\n- Cyberocracy envisions governance integrated with real-time data and algorithmic tools.\n\n## Topics\nAI in government, Human oversight, Operational transparency, Cyberocratic governance, Democratic values",

Cyberocracy and the evolution of digital democracy In a cyberocratic government, the feedback loop between citizen needs, data and policy is significantly accelerated. Traditional governance often relies on periodic statistics, delayed reports and infrequent elections to adjust course. Cyberocracy implies real-time sensing of and reaction to events. For example, consider crisis management: if a natural disaster strikes, a fully integrated government can sense the impact (through sensors, social media signals, emergency calls) in real time and coordinate a response across agencies instantly, dynamically reallocating resources as data on needs comes in. We saw glimpses of this during the COVID-19 pandemic – some countries leveraged near-real- time data on cases, hospital capacity and mobility to inform their policies (for instance, adjusting lockdown measures or vaccine distribution on the fly). A cyberocratic future would generalize this capability: whether it is an economic shock, a public health issue or an environmental threat, governments could respond with agility unheard of in the past, using data-driven simulations and AI to weigh options quickly. Policies themselves could become more conditional and adaptive – for example, a tax policy might automatically adjust rates for certain sectors if indicators show those sectors are struggling, rather than waiting for the next year’s budget law. However, real-time policymaking pushes against the limits of current democratic processes. Democracies are built on deliberation and due process, which take time. If decisions become very rapid, how do we ensure accountability and public input? One possibility is that as data empowers faster executive action, there must be commensurate strengthening of oversight, such as AI tools aiding legislators or requirements that any algorithmic decision rule be transparent and approved by elected officials beforehand. Another aspect is direct citizen participation in real time – perhaps through more frequent digital referenda or citizen votes on issues, enabled by secure e-voting technology. If policies can change week to week based on data, could citizen feedback be gathered as frequently? In Switzerland, referendums every few months are routine; with digital tech, one could theoretically consult citizens much more often. There are risks of decision fatigue or populism if such mechanisms are not designed carefully. Still, we may see democratic innovations like online citizen assemblies or crowdsourced policy proposals operating continuously alongside data-driven administration.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document explores the potential of real-time data and AI to enhance public service delivery and citizen engagement, while also considering the risks of power concentration and reduced transparency. It introduces the concept of cyberocracy, where governments can respond rapidly to crises using data-driven simulations and AI, but highlights the challenges this poses to traditional democratic processes.

    "content": "One intermediate approach is the concept of liquid democracy or delegated voting, where people can delegate their vote on specific issues to trusted experts and reclaim it at any time. Digital voting platforms (building on secure e-voting infrastructure) can enable such flexible representation. The “experts” in this scenario might even include specifically vetted AI models that can represent a citizen’s interests in very specialized policy domains (AI-augmented) – potentially much more knowledgeably than another human could. This remains hypothetical, but it aligns with cyberocracy’s need to combine expertise with broad participation. 40 Another dimension is the information sphere for citizens. In a cyberocratic era, highly available, high- quality information – and tools to make sense of it – will be crucial for meaningful citizen participation. If governance becomes very complex and data- heavy, average citizens could feel left behind without concerted efforts in civic education and user-friendly transparency tools. We can imagine AI-powered interfaces that help explain policies to people in personalized ways. For example, a citizen could ask, “How will the proposed city budget affect me?” and an AI assistant (drawing on government data) could produce a personalized, easy-to-understand answer. Presenting complex information in accessible forms (data visualizations, interactive simulators, personalized summaries) would improve citizen participation by making people better informed and able to see evidence behind the decisions. For instance, if a local government is considering a new traffic policy, a public online simulator might allow any resident to tweak parameters (like closing a street or changing bus frequency) and see the projected impact on congestion or emissions. Engaging citizens in data-driven exploration makes public debates more fact-based. Empirically, when citizens are given unbiased information and tools to understand it, deliberations tend to yield more moderate, consensus- oriented solutions rather than polarized ones. Thus, investing in open data and explanatory tools becomes a democratic imperative in cyberocracy. We must ask: can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? 41 4.3.2.

    "content": "This raises a provocative question: if an AI system significantly influences policy, how do we ensure it aligns with human values and democratic choice? One approach is that if AI inherently involves judgments or biases (as any model trained on human data might), then perhaps citizens or their representatives should “vote” on which AI systems or which parameter settings to use for important decisions. For instance, if an algorithm is used to prioritize infrastructure projects, its criteria (e.g., economic return vs. helping disadvantaged areas) reflect value judgments – those should be democratically determined, not left to engineers or opaque algorithms. Governments or markets might present multiple AI-generated recommendations and have a public consultation or an expert citizens’ jury choose among them. The key point is that algorithmic governance requires oversight. Many jurisdictions are already moving toward this: the EU’s proposed AI Act would classify government AI systems that affect people’s rights as “high-risk,” subjecting them to audits and transparency requirements. Ultimately, maintaining human agency is vital. Cyberocracy should not mean abdicating decisions to black box AI without accountability; it means using AI smartly as a tool for human decision-makers and citizens. In terms of policy co-creation, cyberocracy could enable more of a wiki government approach: policies posted online in draft form for continuous citizen input, with potentially thousands of contributions analyzed (by AI) to improve the proposals. This could become standard: before a government finalizes a major regulation, it runs an online deliberation where any citizen or stakeholder can contribute. Arguments are mapped and rated, often with AI helping to find common ground or summarize themes, and the results inform the final decision. It’s slower than purely top-down decision-making, but perhaps faster than traditional committee processes, and it can produce legitimacy that top-down approaches cannot. For a democratic cyberocracy, we might also see the emergence of algorithmic jurisprudence – where legal rules are at least partly encoded into automated systems. For example, tax formulas could be directly implemented so that taxes are calculated and adjusted in real time with economic changes (indeed, some aspects already are, such as inflation- indexed benefits). However, legal interpretation and value trade-offs will still require human judgment and democratic debate. We may find that parliaments need new technical advisory units to help them write laws that can be implemented in code without ambiguity. Figure 6: Realtime information and AI facilitated policymaking will require to accelerate democratic processes.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the integration of AI in government decision-making, emphasizing the need for democratic oversight and alignment with human values.

    "content": "42 43 4.3.3. Impact on politics, elections and freedom Another aspect to consider is the impact on politics and elections themselves. If governance becomes more continuous and based on performance data, political accountability is likely to shift. Voters may expect real-time results and become more impatient with leaders – or conversely, data transparency could help build trust if it shows genuine improvements. The availability of high-quality live data on government performance (e.g., dashboards for crime rates, school performance, hospital wait times) and on the projected impacts of proposed policies might influence public opinion and election outcomes – for better (more accountability and informed debate) or worse (data misinterpretation or hyper-fragmented messaging). In a best-case scenario, a well-informed electorate could base decisions more on track records and less on rhetoric. But there is also the danger of information overload or the misuse of big data for micro-targeted propaganda, as we have already seen in recent years. Ensuring that quality information is available to all, and not just to some, will be crucial. Efforts to combat disinformation will be even more important in a cyberocracy – without trust in information, the whole model collapses. As Freedom House and others have documented, the past decade has shown how digital tools can spread propaganda and erode democracy in many places. A democratic cyberocracy will need strong institutions to ensure truthful, evidence-based discourse – potentially including public broadcasters with mandates to explain data clearly, educational curricula emphasizing data literacy, and swift responses to false information online. Cyberocratic governance holds great promise for democracies if done right. It could mean governments that respond to citizen needs instantly, policies that continuously improve based on evidence, and citizens who are deeply informed and engaged in the governing process. Cyberocracy can be more efficient at monitoring and managing complexity than bureaucracy and technocracy have been. However, it also comes with serious risks that must be managed: surveillance creep, loss of privacy, algorithmic bias, erosion of deliberative processes and the specter of authoritarian abuse of these technologies. We may lose the very meaning and fabric of our society and culture if we get this wrong. The difference between a digital democracy and a digital dictatorship will hinge on safeguards, transparency and empowerment. In a democracy, cyberocracy must empower citizens – giving them more information and voice – rather than merely surveilling or nudging them without consent.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the potential impact of digital governance on politics and elections, emphasizing the importance of data transparency and accountability. It highlights both the opportunities and risks associated with cyberocracy, such as improved citizen engagement and the dangers of surveillance and misinformation.

The technologies involved are value-neutral; it is our implementation that determines the outcome. If we adhere to the principles discussed, the future can be one in which technology greatly enhances democracy. If we ignore those principles, we may slide into what some call “digital authoritarianism,” where the state uses technology to control and manipulate – a scenario already visible in some countries. The future of democracy in the cyberocratic era will depend on a grand bargain: citizens trust government with a lot of data, and in return government becomes more transparent, accountable and responsive. The best outcome is a virtuous cycle where informed 44 citizens and data-informed officials co-create policy in near-real-time, leading to effective solutions to societal problems – all while upholding fundamental rights. Achieving this will require continuous vigilance: new institutions, such as data ethics councils, algorithm auditors, participatory platforms, and possibly new rights, such as data ownership rights and rights to explanation for AI decisions, will need to be established. But if done well, cyberocracy could revitalize democracy for the 21st century. Figure 7: Whole-of-government system-level efficiency framework with a path to democratic cyberocracy. 45 Conclusion and key recommendations 5. 46 In earlier chapters, we outlined what constitutes system-level efficiency and what constrains its achievement. We looked at how one system – democracy – has achieved high levels of system efficiency and identified the core principles of democracy that contribute to that success by design. We also mapped these principles onto key information system design decisions. Then we showed how these design decisions can be implemented in practice through technology, and what implications this has for the governance of societies. Now we will sum up the macro-level implications. One way to visualize the argument is with two triangles: one standing upright and one inverted. The choices made at the foundational layers (the base of the triangle) determine the freedoms and efficiencies at the top. Figure 8: System design principles leading to different levels of efficiency and freedom. 47 In a democracy designed with bottom-up principles, freedoms widen toward the top because the system is set up to allow maximum choice and autonomy by design. In a digital dictatorship, by deliberate design, power is concentrated at the top – leading to fewer freedoms and less capacity for self-organization.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the potential for technology to enhance democracy by ensuring transparency, accountability, and responsiveness in governance.

    "content": "The result is low system efficiency, even if such a regime may achieve strong operational efficiency in some isolated domains. In short, a choice to centralize may feel secure at first but it will reduce the room for action later and is never a basis for a self-organizing, resilient ecosystem. If you centralize your architecture and decision-making, you maximize control and dependency, stifling competition and innovation; eventually, at the very top – where policy choices and service designs are made – there will be far less freedom or flexibility. In an overly centralized model, the CTO effectively becomes the de facto CEO of government. Modern democracies do not look like that. Their freedoms widen at the top rather than narrow, because the system is built to allow for maximum freedom and choice from the bottom up through the core principles that govern us. A digital dictatorship, however, narrows freedoms at the top: a deliberate decision to centralize will concentrate power and inevitably lead to fewer choices and less self-organization capacity. What are the implications? The first is that our digital government leaders – and the technical and policy decisions they make – will shape how our government and society look in the future. Not immediately, but over time, as each layer of technology and policy is built on the last. Unfortunately, we will only fully know the consequences in hindsight. However, as discussed earlier, we can emulate systems that have stood the test of time – democracies – and aim for system efficiency that is complex yet still self-organizing. Or simply, we can copy what works. 48 Key recommendations Governments must adopt technology to increase public-sector efficiency and deliver greater public value. In doing so, they will need to navigate policy choices that affect the design of digital government. Thesis of this paper is that these same design and policy choices determine (or strongly influence) the form of governance itself. In optimizing system-level (whole-of- government) efficiency, democratic principles drive government efficiency – because those principles fundamentally lead to better performance at scale. The key recommendations are: Embed core democratic principles into digital transformation and initiatives Treat the principles of participation, transparency, competition, subsidiarity, accountability, and civic inclusion as design criteria for digital initiatives.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the drawbacks of centralizing digital government systems, which can lead to reduced innovation and flexibility. It advocates for adopting democratic principles in digital transformations to enhance government efficiency and public value. By embedding participation, transparency, and accountability into digital initiatives, governments can improve their operational effectiveness.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Centralization in digital government systems can stifle innovation and flexibility.\n- Democratic principles should guide digital transformations to improve government efficiency.\n- Key democratic principles include participation, transparency, and accountability.\n- Digital government leaders' decisions will shape future governance and society.\n- The document recommends treating democratic principles as design criteria for digital initiatives.\n\n## Topics\nDigital Government, System Efficiency, Democratic Principles, Centralization Risks, Public Sector Innovation",

    "content": "Ensure a variety of service delivery channels and use the ones people prefer (participation); mandate transparency of algorithms and decisions; prefer interoperable, competitive solutions over monolithic ones; push decision-making authority and data ownership to the local or individual level whenever effective (subsidiarity); enforce checks and balances in data governance and system access; and ensure every citizen can access digital services (through inclusive design and assistive measures). By aligning technology projects with these democratic principles, governments not only improve performance but also reinforce public trust and legitimacy. Build a secure, trusted digital foundation with democratic safeguards Invest in high-quality base registries, unique identifiers for people and businesses, secure data exchange (interoperability) infrastructure, and universal digital identity with e-signatures. Ensure legal and institutional checks and balances in this foundational infrastructure so that no single authority can abuse concentrated data or power. This foundation should emphasize privacy, security and transparency by design to build public trust from the ground up. Manage complexity, resilience and sovereignty proactively Embed organizational goals to simplify processes and legacy systems wherever possible to reduce complexity. Use modular architectures and open standards to make 01. 02. 03. 49 systems adaptable and interoperable. Incorporate resilience strategies (redundancy, decentralization of critical systems, contingency planning) so that services withstand shocks and cyber threats. Prioritize digital sovereignty for critical systems – adopt open-source or multiple-vendor solutions to avoid lock-in, and ensure critical data and systems remain under national or democratic control. Build horizontal and vertical integration across domains using same principles. Deliver citizen-centric, integrated services (personalized and proactive) Redesign services around life events or user needs, minimizing the burden on citizens. Implement the once-only principle so that citizens and businesses never have to provide the same information twice. Strive for single front-door access to services (one-stop portals or apps) and proactive service delivery (where the government initiates or pre-fills services when data indicates a need). Ensure that integration of services across agencies doesn’t erode accountability: maintain clear ownership of data and functions and use legal frameworks to enable responsible data sharing and leverage emerging technologies such as self-organizing agentic services where applicable. Focus on user experience and inclusiveness across all channels (web, mobile and in person) to boost adoption and satisfaction. Apply automation and AI responsibly, with humans in the loop Use rule-based automation as the default for well-defined, rule-based processes – this improves speed, consistency and transparency in service delivery.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines strategies for enhancing government efficiency through digital transformation, emphasizing citizen-centric service delivery, data governance, and digital sovereignty.

For all AI deployments, implement strong accountability measures: human oversight for critical decisions, explainability requirements, audit logs, and regular bias evaluations. In other words, treat AI as an assistant to human officials and citizens, not a replacement – maintaining the primacy of human judgment, especially in critical decisions affecting rights or entitlements. By following these recommendations, governments can modernize and become more efficient without compromising the fundamental values of democracy. In fact, as we have argued, those democratic principles are themselves drivers of long-term efficiency and performance.

    "content": "States that made a more substantial commitment to digitalization are benefitting from it today, often seeing an increase in the overall effectiveness of their public sector. These states will have an advantage over their geopolitical rivals in the emerging digital world order. For states that did not digitalize or view it as a priority early on, recent crises have forced policymakers to realize the necessity of digital technologies for running a state in the 21st century. States are currently navigating a time defined by multiple crises, a polycrisis. COVID-19 brought the physical world to a standstill for much of 2020. As a result, many governments could not operate or deliver many of their services. Climate change is also becoming increasingly disruptive for governments as natural disasters grow in number and severity. Some states may experience worsening wildfires; others may see an increase in the scale of flooding; some countries like Tuvalu may even face the loss of their physical territory. Conflict is on the rise, as demonstrated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and a growth in tension between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Democratic states are also facing an increase in internal crises; for example, new challenges are emerging due to democratic backsliding, declining voter turnout, and dissatisfaction with democracy more broadly. States are being forced to manage numerous ongoing crises at any given time, both domestically and internationally, in addition to their other critical responsibilities. Usually, states must do this with a public sector facing a shrinking budget, workforce, and ever-growing demands for efficiency and effectiveness. The only way to navigate these challenges successfully is by embracing the potential of digital technologies. This is what the world has seen. Digital states were better able to manage the COVID-19 pandemic than those that were not. Digital technologies also play a key role in monitoring, managing, or curtailing the impact of natural disasters. In conflict, states that can better leverage digital technologies, especially those that enable connectivity and data-driven decision-making, will have the advantage. Thus, the world is witnessing the rise of new digital states where digital technologies and data are core to the functioning of the state itself. However, as a result, these states introduce new dependences on technology. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 This is not something that should be feared, but it is something that should be respected. It is of the utmost importance that when states embark on their path toward digitalization, they prioritize the long-term resilience of the digital infrastructure that they are building.\n\n---\n## Summary\nStates that have prioritized digitalization are reaping benefits in public sector effectiveness and resilience against crises like COVID-19 and climate change. Those that lagged in digital adoption are now recognizing its necessity amid ongoing global challenges. The rise of digital states underscores the importance of building resilient digital infrastructure to navigate future uncertainties.\n\n## Key Facts\n- States with strong digitalization efforts have increased public sector effectiveness.\n- COVID-19 highlighted the necessity of digital technologies for government operations.\n- Climate change and conflicts are increasing the demand for digital solutions.\n- Digital states are better equipped to handle crises and manage resources efficiently.\n- Building resilient digital infrastructure is crucial for long-term state stability.\n\n## Topics\nDigitalization in government, Crisis management, Public sector effectiveness, Climate change impact, Digital infrastructure resilience",

    "content": "This report was written to help guide policymakers interested in building and developing better, stronger, and more robust digital states. To do this, the report provides an overview of key progress made in creating government resilience in the digital age, and through this also the history of the current digital world order. Following this, the report adopts a scenario-based approach to illustrate the sorts of crises that states must prepare their digital infrastructure for. Drawing on the insights of this scenario, the report introduces seven key policy recommendations intended to help build and strengthen the resilience of a state’s digital infrastructure. Æ First, states must adopt a digital- first approach to public services and registries related to the continuity of the state. Æ Second, states must start enabling the transition to public sector jobs that can operate in a remote-first or remote-enabled manner. Æ Third, states must prioritize the security of their digital infrastructure and services. Æ Fourth, states must ensure resilience in connectivity by viewing internet access as critical infrastructure. Æ Fifth, states must improve their resilience by reducing opportunities for physical damage to disrupt their digital operations. Æ Sixth, states must invest in the ability to manage third-party risk without limiting opportunities for technological innovation. Æ Seventh, governments must adopt a whole-of-government approach to developing digital resilience. States that adopt the above recommendations when building their digital infrastructure, accompanied by the necessary organizational and policy changes, will be rewarded with a resilient digital state. If built properly, a sufficiently resilient digital state could run its core and critical digital services even if there was a temporary or more long- term loss of its physical territory due to a crisis. This is something that is now only possible due to technology. It also represents the need to shift how we think about states in this new digital world where digital is no longer tied to the physical boundaries of a nation. 6 The future of democracy is digital. During the pandemic nearly 30% of governments in Europe postponed elections between 2020–2022 [10], which arguably damaged their democratic process. Digital state processes have become a necessity to better protect our states during crises. 7 INTRODUCTION In the aftermath of the Second World War, the global community developed the foundations for a new geopolitical order aligned with liberal values. The number of democratically aligned states began to grow during the same period; democracy represented hope and a vision of a better future. Following the defeat and dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, optimism continued to grow.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe report outlines strategies for building resilient digital states, emphasizing the importance of digital infrastructure in maintaining state functions during crises. It provides seven key policy recommendations, including adopting a digital-first approach, ensuring connectivity, and managing third-party risks.

    "content": "For the first time in history, most of the world’s population lived in states defined by liberal and democratic values [1]. During this period of democratization, another foundation of today’s world came to the forefront – the internet. The internet and its global spread transformed the way the world communicated and bolstered support for the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom. In a 1994 speech, Vice President Al Gore hoped that “Central and Eastern Europe can use technology and the free market to build democracy – not thwart it. [2]” Several months later, he echoed these sentiments and his belief in the positive potential of the internet to “derive robust and sustainable economic progress, strong democracies, [and] better solutions to global and local environmental challenges. [3]” It was clear that technology, especially the internet, could transform the world’s thoughts about states and governments. Though many states started experimenting with technology to reimagine their governments, not all were fully committed or successful. Some states also saw technology as posing a potential threat to the state. It was argued that if the computerization of society could “alter the entire nervous system of social organization,” then these developments would “change the stakes of sovereignty” [4] as private sector companies came to challenge the state’s control over communications. In contrast, Estonia, which restored its independence in 1991, stands out as one of the few countries that fully embraced technology early on. Estonia’s first information development plan, “The Estonian Road to an Information Society”, was released in 1994 and argued that technology would play a vital role in the future of states, improving their efficiency and helping to strengthen and secure their culture, sovereignty, and security. Importantly, this strategy also saw the private sector not as a barrier or a challenge to the state but a key component in helping the government achieve its digitalization goal. Now, more than three decades later, it is possible to look back and reflect on these early beliefs about the liberal geopolitical order, democracy, states, governments, technology, and the relationship between them. What emerges is an image of a new 8 digital world. In this new world, however, democratic states are being challenged by democratic backsliding [5], declining voter turnout [6], and increasing dissatisfaction amongst voters [7] are beginning to weaken.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe global spread of the internet has significantly influenced the promotion of democratic values and transformed communication worldwide. While some countries have embraced technology to enhance governance, others have viewed it as a threat to state sovereignty. Estonia is highlighted as a successful example of integrating technology into government, contrasting with the challenges of democratic backsliding and declining voter engagement in other democracies.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The internet played a crucial role in promoting liberty, democracy, and freedom globally.\n- Vice President Al Gore advocated for technology to support democracy and economic progress in the 1990s.\n- Estonia embraced technology early, releasing its first information development plan in 1994.\n- Estonia viewed the private sector as essential to achieving its digitalization goals.\n- Democratic states face challenges like democratic backsliding and declining voter turnout.\n\n## Topics\nInternet and democracy, Technology in governance, Estonia digitalization, Democratic challenges, State sovereignty",

    "content": "While fighting to maintain their democratic systems of government and pushing back the growing global influence of authoritarianism [8], democratic states also face unprecedented external challenges to their stability and safety. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caught many off guard and exposed numerous weaknesses in government operations. However, the pandemic also showed that states that could leverage data and technology more effectively performed better [9]. During the pandemic nearly 30% of governments in Europe postponed elections between 2020–2022 [10], which arguably damaged their democratic process. Even fewer states were able to seamlessly transition to remote schooling, damaging the education and learning of children. Climate change, too, is making itself increasingly known, with natural disasters becoming increasingly common and growing in severity and intensity. For some states, this means bearing the brunt of powerful floods, hurricanes, or fires for others, they are facing a future where their entire physical territory will disappear within their lifetime [11]. If before it was possible to ignore the benefits and positive potential of digitalization for states, today, this is no longer the case. States that do not digitalize will be left behind, increasingly vulnerable in a world defined by technology. Technology must be viewed as an essential and integral component of the state to overcome and address the world’s growing complexity today. Many states now realise this and are investing large amounts of resources into digitalization. The European Union alone has budgeted more than €100 billion to help support the development of a digital and resilient Europe [12]. Digitalization will improve how effective and efficient states run, but it also brings new challenges and threats. Many states cannot independently develop, build, or sustain the digital infrastructure and technologies they require and have engaged heavily with private sector technology companies [13]. This growing reliance on the private sector has led policymakers and academics to argue that there is an ongoing “coup,” [14] where technology companies have begun to overtake and consume the state. These fears are even stronger when the companies relied upon are based within foreign states. There has been growing interest in policies supporting “digital sovereignty” and “data sovereignty” [15] to counteract these fears. Though such concerns are understandable, by tying digital infrastructure to the physical territory of a specific country new vulnerabilities are created. Similarly, by trying to reduce the power or strength of the largest technology industry the ability of the state to defend itself in the cyber domain is also weakened.\n\n---\n## Summary\nDemocratic states face challenges from both authoritarian influences and external threats like pandemics and climate change, highlighting the importance of digitalization for resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in government operations, but also showed that states leveraging technology effectively performed better. However, reliance on private sector technology companies raises concerns about digital sovereignty and the potential for these companies to overshadow state power.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Nearly 30% of European governments postponed elections between 2020-2022 due to the pandemic.\n- The European Union has budgeted over €100 billion to support digitalization and resilience.\n- There is a growing concern about technology companies overtaking state functions, referred to as a 'coup.'\n- Digital sovereignty and data sovereignty are gaining interest to counteract reliance on foreign technology companies.\n- Climate change is causing more frequent and severe natural disasters, threatening state stability.\n\n## Topics\nDemocratic resilience, Digitalization challenges, Pandemic impact, Climate change threats, Technology reliance",

    "content": "Yet, peace no longer exists in the digital world, and digital infrastructure is a clear target. The private sector plays a critical role in helping to defend states against robust, consistent, and comprehensive cyber threats from hostile nations daily [16]. These threats are real. In 2007, Estonia was targeted by a large cyber-attack significantly disrupted the country’s normal operations. In the current war in Ukraine, Russia utilised both digital and physical means to disrupt Ukraine’s ability to operate digitally targeting 9 key data centres with both malware and cruise missiles [17]. With military tensions continuing to rise between Taiwan and China, many have argued that China’s first steps are likely to target Taiwan’s critical digital infrastructure [18]. As threats to the physical territory of liberal and democratically aligned states continue to grow from conflict and other factors, it is important to think through how to build more robust and resilient digital states. Building and investing in a better, stronger, and more resilient digital future will not only help ensure the longevity of democratic states themselves, but also provide them with new opportunities to sell their vision of a new digital geopolitical order. This report represents a first step in this process, challenging the existing conceptualisation of what it means to be a state in today’s digital age. To aid this conceptual exercise, the report identifies several scenarios states may encounter in the decades ahead and explores how digital technologies could be used to overcome them. Following this exploration, the report identifies and offers several key policies and building blocks for constructing more robust and resilient digital states. 10 11 CHALLENGES TO THE CONTINUITY OF THE STATE Crises and natural disasters have always been a part of our world. Whether they are the result of political, economic, social, or environmental factors, crises often share common characteristics that result in widespread disruption to societies and individuals. Historically, crises have often played a pivotal role in influencing the fate of a state. History is full of examples that demonstrate how states, when unable to overcome the challenges posed by a crisis, decline in power and influence or in some cases even cease to exist [19]. While the root causes of many crises remain similar today as they were centuries ago, for example when confronting a large natural disaster, war, or a pandemic, the world of today is more interconnected than ever before. As a result, the difficulty of addressing a crisis has rapidly increased in complexity and its potential impact is larger in scale.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe digital world is increasingly under threat from cyber-attacks, with private sectors playing a crucial role in defending against these threats. Historical examples, such as the 2007 cyber-attack on Estonia and current tensions involving Ukraine and Taiwan, highlight the vulnerability of digital infrastructure. The report emphasizes the need for robust digital resilience to ensure the longevity of democratic states and proposes policies for building resilient digital infrastructures.\n\n## Key Facts\n- In 2007, Estonia was targeted by a large cyber-attack that disrupted its operations.\n- Russia has used digital and physical means to disrupt Ukraine's digital operations during the current conflict.\n- China is expected to target Taiwan's digital infrastructure amid rising military tensions.\n- The report identifies scenarios and policies for building resilient digital states.\n- Crises, whether political, economic, or environmental, have historically influenced the fate of states.\n\n## Topics\nCyber threats, Digital resilience, State continuity, Geopolitical tensions",

    "content": "Due to the digital and integrated nature of the world, states are dependent on global supply chains, resources, and technology [20]. Recent examples of this include the COVID-19 pandemic which caused global supply chain disruption that continues to this day [21], the WannaCry ransomware attack, and the War in Ukraine. Importantly, as today’s world is digital, it is no longer possible to separate the physical and the virtual worlds. In each of the above examples significant impact was felt in both realms at the same time. Today, the destruction of the virtual environment or critical datasets can cause more harm than the destruction of a building or physical infrastructure. During times of conflict, which is also becoming increasingly digital, denying your adversary’s access to cyberspace and digital services could bring the functioning of the state to a halt. While increasing levels of digitalization and technological innovation create new vulnerabilities for states, they also provide the means to make societies more resilient than ever before. Through technological development and strategic, comprehensive, digitalization of society it is possible for states to increase their resilience by reducing their dependence on the physical realm. In the next chapter the report examines in more detail what policies can be implemented to make government more resilient in the digital age. 12 WHAT IS THE THREAT? EXAMPLE UNMITIGATED CRISIS SCENARIO Natural disasters, climate change, or military conflicts have resulted in significant disruptions to the standard operations of national services, causing them to be limited or, in certain instances, entirely non- operational. The immediate aftermath of these disasters reveals a grim scenario where critical infrastructure has sustained extensive physical degradation. Numerous domestic data centres have been destroyed, leaving a significant portion of the national digital backbone inoperable. The reliability of electricity has become erratic, and the continuity of fuel supply is compromised. Furthermore, the local telecommunications infrastructure has been critically damaged, impeding effective communication. In parallel, cyberattacks or the destruction of digital infrastructure may also occur, rendering some services permanently or temporarily unavailable. The interdependencies between registries and services can lead to cascading effects, causing an increasing number of services across different sectors to become unavailable. In such cases, alternative operating procedures shall be activated. As a result, the continuous operation of digital services has been severely restricted, making it almost impossible to maintain the modern way of living.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the increasing reliance of states on global supply chains and digital infrastructure, highlighting how events like the COVID-19 pandemic and cyberattacks have disrupted these systems. It emphasizes the intertwined nature of physical and digital realms, where damage to digital infrastructure can be as harmful as physical destruction. The report suggests that while digitalization introduces vulnerabilities, it also offers opportunities for enhancing state resilience by reducing dependence on physical infrastructure.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The COVID-19 pandemic caused ongoing global supply chain disruptions.\n- Digital and physical worlds are now inseparable, impacting both realms simultaneously.\n- Destruction of digital infrastructure can be more damaging than physical infrastructure.\n- Cyberattacks can halt state functions by denying access to cyberspace.\n- Technological innovation can enhance state resilience by reducing physical dependencies.\n\n## Topics\nDigital Resilience, Global Supply Chains, Cybersecurity Threats, Technological Innovation, State Vulnerabilities",

    "content": "The dependencies among registries, various information systems, and underlying national services, such as electronic identification, have become starkly apparent as some systems fail due to the issues. The nature of the crisis, the extent of the affected physical territory, and the low level of preparedness have collectively contributed to the realization of these risks. In response, some registries (paper or digital) may have been relocated to safer zones, while others remain offline – temporarily or permanently. In the worst case, critical data assets and their backups could be destroyed permanently or irreversibly corrupted, leading to a devastating data loss. The state and the services that rely on these registries are facing significant challenges; a few can function, but others have ceased to operate due to the lack of essential data. This gradual deterioration of public services is having a broader impact on public sentiment and opinion. Access to information is severely constrained, leading to widespread fear and uncertainty among the population. The state now faces the daunting task of ensuring the short-term continuance of governance and providing support to displaced individuals who have managed to seek safety elsewhere. THE START OF THE CRISIS: 13 Due to the ongoing crisis, a significant portion of the physical territory of the state has become uninhabitable. The government is grappling with the challenge of survival, while contemplating the possibility of conducting some operations in exile. In this context, the resilience of the state’s democratic institutions amidst climate change or prolonged conflicts, as well as the long-term preservation of the nation and its cultural heritage, has emerged as a strategic objective. Compelled to function with a diminished number of services, it is imperative that the state can continue to update information about citizens, ownership, cultural heritage, etc., to ensure the continuity of nationhood and facilitate the restoration of the nation following the prolonged crisis. Moreover, citizens still require access to governmental services while in exile. Certain information from national registries will be transferred to foreign registries to facilitate the use of essential services, such as medical and educational data. It is essential that educational resources, such as schoolbooks, and virtual schooling be made available to sustain the language and culture in both the short and long term. Failure to provide such services would eventually lead citizens to lose their connection to their homeland. This gradual erosion of national identity will cause the nation to lose its political and cultural distinctiveness.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the impact of a crisis on national registries and information systems, highlighting the challenges faced by the state in maintaining essential services and data integrity. The crisis has made parts of the territory uninhabitable, forcing the government to consider operating in exile while ensuring the continuity of governance and cultural preservation. The state aims to transfer critical information to foreign registries and provide educational resources to maintain national identity and support citizens in exile.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The crisis has rendered a significant portion of the state's territory uninhabitable.\n- Some registries have been relocated or remain offline due to the crisis.\n- The state is considering conducting operations in exile to maintain governance.\n- Critical data assets risk permanent loss or corruption, affecting public services.\n- Educational resources are crucial for maintaining national identity during the crisis.\n\n## Topics\nNational registries, Crisis impact, Government resilience, Data integrity, Cultural preservation",

    "content": "Consequently, individuals will no longer feel a sense of belonging, ultimately leading to a point where the state’s continuity is compromised and rendered unsustainable under external pressures. CONTINUATION OF THE CRISIS: 14 POLICIES FOR BUILDING RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES In the two previous chapters, the report outlined how digital technologies and a growth in the number and severity of crises increasingly define the world of today. To remain relevant, states must digitalize; this is no longer optional. As the internal functions of the state become increasingly digital, it is essential to ensure their long-term resilience and reliability. This is especially important as states worldwide continue to face multiple, interconnected, and complex crises, from war to pandemics to climate change. Each of these may have a significant impact on the functioning of the state, for example, by disrupting internet connectivity, closing physical offices of public servants, or even causing destruction of data assets critical to the state. As states undergo the transformation into new digital states, it is of the utmost importance to think strategically about how to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure that, even if unlikely in the short-term, have a high probability of occurring in the long-term. Drawing on the potential challenges and side effects that may follow a crisis, such as the one described above, this section outlines seven recommendations to increase the digital resilience of the state. These recommendations, if adopted, will help to ensure that a digital state can function even when facing the worst of crises. In the worst-case scenario, they would help enable a state to run digitally even if it no longer maintained control over its physical territory. 15 ADOPT A DIGITAL- FIRST APPROACH TO CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND REGISTRIES Digital rather than paper registries and services are more reliable and efficient, especially in crisis situations. Unfortunately, many governments have not digitalized their critical services related to the continuity of the state and the nation. To increase the state’s reliability and resilience the digitalization of such services must be prioritized. TRANSITION TO REMOTE-FIRST AND REMOTE-ENABLED PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS Civil servants that assure the continuity of digital public infrastructure and services are affected by crises just as much as the rest of the population. Enabling public sector jobs to operate completely remotely is necessary for increasing national resilience.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe report emphasizes the necessity for states to digitalize their functions to remain resilient amidst increasing global crises such as wars, pandemics, and climate change.

    "content": "01 02 SECURE THE STATE’S DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES Successfully denying access to, or tampering with, critical digital data, services, and registries is essential to ensuring the legitimacy of a digital state. Establishing mandatory security standards and requirements for public services and infrastructure from both internal and external threats provides the means to increase the long-term cyber resilience of the state. ENSURE WIDESPREAD AFFORDABLE ACCESS AND REDUNDANCY TO CONNECTIVITY In today’s digital age, access to the internet is becoming as crucial as access to other infrastructure and amenities. The state must explore all technology options available for ensuring resilience. 03 04 16 BUILD REDUNDANCY- POTENTIALLY BEYOND TERRITORIAL BORDERS- TO DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES States must guarantee that digital public services and infrastructure are safeguarded against physical destruction resulting from the operation of these digital services within a limited physical space. This may involve positioning at least part of the infrastructure beyond their own territorial borders. In doing so, governments must also resolve issues on mutual trust to be capable of providing a safe harbour for digital governments on foreign territory. MANAGE THIRD- PARTY RISK WHILE PRESERVING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION Almost all digital public services and infrastructure contain technological “black boxes” not properly auditable, transparent, and may even challenge the digital sovereignty of the state. As the world continues to digitalize this trend will continue. Procedures should be established to mitigate this risk to a reasonable level that does not severely inhibit innovation, avoiding over-regulation. 05 06 CREATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE Government resilience involves decentralized responsibility for each government function, but to avoid cascading failures, a coordinated top-down approach is also needed. The appointment of a centralized body is recommended to oversee and ensure the execution of policies aimed at increasing resilience and continuity across all government levels. 07 17 01 ADOPT A DIGITAL-FIRST APPROACH TO CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND REGISTRIES A key component for any digital state will be the development and maintenance of digital registries. These registries are responsible for maintaining up-to-date information on all aspects of the state, from registering births to managing real estate ownership. For such a system to work effectively, states rely on the public’s trust in government institutions as well as a system of justice that fairly protects a citizen’s rights.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines strategies for enhancing the resilience of a digital state by securing digital infrastructure, ensuring widespread and affordable internet access, and building redundancy in digital services. It emphasizes the importance of managing third-party risks while fostering technological innovation and creating institutional capacity for government resilience. A digital-first approach to public services and registries is also recommended to maintain public trust and protect citizens' rights.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Mandatory security standards are essential for protecting digital infrastructure from threats.\n- Redundancy in digital infrastructure may require positioning services beyond territorial borders.\n- Managing third-party risks is crucial to preserving digital sovereignty and innovation.\n- A centralized body should oversee policies for government resilience and continuity.\n- A digital-first approach is vital for maintaining up-to-date public registries and services.\n\n## Topics\nDigital infrastructure security, Internet access redundancy, Third-party risk management, Government resilience, Digital public services",

    "content": "In the digital age, ownership is mostly defined by data in digital registries and various systems distributed across public and private sector. The ownership of all significant things – parenthood, property, education, inheritance, even medical history, shares, wealth – is inherently digital. In such a system, digital data and information would take precedent over physical alternatives – this is the most efficient and resilient way to govern today. Today, most modern governments have some form of digital registries and online services, but the transformation is usually partial at best. For example, some states may allow for people to apply online for a driving license, but they likely must collect the document physically at a government building. This is a problem that can be solved with technology; the limitations to broader digitalization are almost always related directly to legacy procedures, legal frameworks, or a lack of trust. It is for this reason why digital states must not stop only at investing in technology but must rethink their internal processes and operations by adopting a digital-first approach to the public sector. The digital registries, services, information, and assets critical to the continuity of the state must be made accessible from anywhere (i.e., digital) and provide end-to-end outcomes. Getting this right will require states to understand which registries, services, and assets should be viewed as “critical” for the long-term resilience of the digital state. Four especially relevant categories are presented below, which can be further categorized by their relevance to continuity of the state and their relevance to ensuring the flow of critical public services. 18 1. State governance. Services within this category include elections and voting, registry of laws and regulations, state decisions, strategic communications and state announcements. During a long-term crisis, such as a war, are likely to have a significant impact on this category. 2. Registries of ownership, obligations and justice. This category includes the most important registries: the population registry, business registry, property registers (cadastre, vehicles etc.), taxes, criminal records and other legal facts. 3. Citizen services. This category includes services such as getting new passport and identity documents, obtaining internationally recognized licenses and certificates (e.g. of education), receiving social benefits, and paying taxes. It also includes services related to the preservation of the national identity, such as access to the national archive, public broadcasting archive, national literature, and educational materials and assets to continue schooling. 4. International integrations with neighbours.\n\n---\n## Summary\nIn the digital age, ownership is primarily defined by data in digital registries across both public and private sectors. Modern governments often have partial digital transformations, hindered by legacy systems and lack of trust, necessitating a digital-first approach to enhance resilience. Critical areas for digitalization include state governance, registries of ownership, citizen services, and international integrations.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Digital ownership encompasses parenthood, property, education, and medical history.\n- Governments face challenges in digital transformation due to legacy procedures and legal frameworks.\n- Key digitalization areas include state governance, ownership registries, and citizen services.\n- Digital-first approaches are essential for modern governance resilience.\n- Critical services must be accessible digitally and provide end-to-end outcomes.\n\n## Topics\nDigital ownership, Government digitalization, State governance, Citizen services",

    "content": "This category is related to services that enable cross-border information exchange. These services are especially useful if a crisis is accompanied by the mass movement of people into new territory, for example by providing them with a form of digital identity that can be easily exported. For services managed or owned by third parties (e.g., private sector entities), a mechanism could be introduced to incentivize digital development. For instance, when procuring educational books for children, digital versions should also be required. Unlike physical books, which can be damaged or become inaccessible, digital copies can be widely distributed and remain accessible, proving especially valuable in times of crisis. 19 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Identify which services and registries are critical for the long-term continuity of both the state and the nation in various state of emergency scenarios. Æ Implement a policy that requires the digital transformation of public services deemed vital for the state’s long-term continuity. Æ Adopt a policy that prioritizes the development of digital-first services and assets, ensuring compliance with established security standards and requirements. Figure: Government mobile services can provide widespread, accessible and cost-efficient access to public services and documents. And have potential of taking them also cross-border. 20 02 TRANSITION TO REMOTE-FIRST AND REMOTE-ENABLED PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS Adopting a digital-first approach to public service delivery will help to free up human resources as services become more efficient, automatic, or proactive but there will still be a need for public servants to ensure that systems remain operational and secure. For public servants working with critical services, during a time of crisis it is even more important that they can do their job. However, it is also likely that they too will be impacted during a crisis or state of emergency and their ability to operate from a physical office may not be possible. The solution is to enable public sector workers connected to the operation of critical services the ability to work fully remotely. There are three primary considerations to consider when adopting a remote-first approach to the public sector workforce: 1. The transition of work to secure digital channels. 2. Ensure the internal systems, software and infrastructure are universally available and accessible remotely. 3. The establishment of new, remote- friendly digital internal decision-making, leadership, processes, and audit trails. These changes are hard to do but are also a key component of ensuring the long-term resilience of the digital state. Usually, digitalizing a service or its infrastructure is the easiest part of the solution.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of digital transformation in government services to enhance resilience, particularly during crises that involve mass migration. It emphasizes the need for digital identities and digital-first services, which can be more accessible and durable than physical alternatives. It also highlights the transition to remote-first public sector jobs to ensure continuity and security of critical services during emergencies.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Digital identities can facilitate cross-border information exchange during crises.\n- Digital versions of educational materials are recommended for resilience in emergencies.\n- Policies should prioritize digital-first services for long-term state continuity.\n- Remote-first public sector jobs ensure operational continuity during crises.\n- Secure digital channels are essential for remote public sector work.\n\n## Topics\nDigital transformation, Public sector resilience, Remote work policies, Cross-border services",

    "content": "Instead, the hardest aspect is transforming the organization itself, its decision- making processes, and its culture. Often organizations rely on paper or some key assets that can only be accessed locally, limiting opportunities for change and remote operations. To overcome this challenge, it is possible to develop a model that differentiates between “remote-first” and “remote-enabled” jobs in the public sector. Remote-first jobs are those where it would be mandatory to be capable of working long-term remotely, with all organizational processes and systems supporting this. Remote-enabled jobs are those that could be required to work remotely under specific constraints, such as having flexibility toward the equipment needs and physical workplace. It is not enough to have remote workforce policies or strategies in place, but these changes must be followed. By enabling remote operations of the digital state de- facto, it will help to build resilience in the event of a disruptive crisis. This readiness can be further increased by running crisis exercises. These exercises involve creating a controlled environment for simulating the conditions of a crisis, testing whether the developed remote working operations operate as anticipated. 21 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Identify public authorities and positions related to critical services for the continuity of the state and develop a categorization for jobs that should be remote-first or remote-enabled. Æ Identify infrastructure and systems not accessible from a remote-first perspective. Æ Establish a long-term IT and organizational strategy to shift to remote-first and remote- enabled jobs. Æ Create an independent unit responsible for assessing organizational barriers to the remote- first transition and running annual or quarterly exercises that test an organization’s ability to operate under remote working conditions. 22 03 SECURE DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES In the digital age, the notion of conflict has changed. Cyberattacks are a daily occurrence and an unavoidable part of the world’s new digital reality. As states continue to digitalize, it is essential that cyber security and the protection of digital infrastructure is made a priority. Estonia has been on both sides of this new reality. In 2007, Estonia suffered one of the first national scale cyberattacks in the world. As a result, Estonia implemented new laws and regulations, developed standards, and devoted large amounts of resources into improving their cyber defense capabilities. In the years that have passed, Estonia has managed to successfully defend against numerous massive cyberattacks without significant disruption to its digital society. In most cases, Estonian residents do not even know such events have taken place.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the challenges and strategies for transforming public sector organizations to be more resilient and capable of remote operations. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between 'remote-first' and 'remote-enabled' jobs and the necessity of cybersecurity measures to protect digital infrastructure. Estonia's experience with cyberattacks highlights the need for robust cyber defense systems in the digital age.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Remote-first jobs require long-term remote work capabilities with full organizational support.\n- Remote-enabled jobs can work remotely under specific constraints, such as equipment flexibility.\n- Crisis exercises are recommended to test remote working operations in simulated crisis conditions.\n- Estonia has successfully defended against numerous cyberattacks since a major incident in 2007.\n- The document suggests creating an independent unit to assess barriers to remote-first transitions.\n\n## Topics\nRemote work transformation, Public sector resilience, Cybersecurity measures, Digital infrastructure protection, Crisis preparedness",

    "content": "However, this threat will always be present. As much of a state’s critical infrastructure has become digital – even physical infrastructure, such as power plants or hospitals – cyber defense must be a national priority. Over the past decades, it has become increasingly clear that while it is possible to build walls around systems, and strongly defend them, if an attacker is significantly resourced and motivated, they will find a way to infiltrate their target’s systems. As there is no peace in cyberspace, these digital systems must always be built from the perspective of wartime resilience. Investments in cybersecurity cannot be made post-factum they must be implemented from inception. Ultimately, the long-term best practice is to develop a set of principles for the digital state that (when complied with) significantly increase the cost and time for an attack to be successful. Additionally, as threats are constantly evolving, the countermeasures must too. Digital states must assess and leverage modern solutions and tools to actively monitor, analyze, and respond to cyber incidents, including the use of cloud-based threat intelligence, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for pattern recognition. Gathered threat intelligence must be shared real-time through collaborative platforms across the state and internationally by like-minded nations to enhance its ability to respond and coordinate effectively. In addition to external threats, countries must also secure the digital state from internal threats. Data integrity must be made a priority so that not even the people guarding or maintaining data for the state are able to change it without a trace being left. The Estonian government started using technologies such as blockchain to assure critical registries cannot be tampered with [22]. Getting this ecosystem right, with cybersecurity at the forefront, will require a digital state to build up its national and institutional cyber capabilities. By creating a community of collaboration between regulators, service providers, research organizations, universities, and companies it is possible to help develop this expertise. 23 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Mandate nationwide adherence to cybersecurity standards and industry best practices while considering nation-wide risk scenarios and enforcing minimum security measures accordingly. Æ Assign a security and criticality classification to information systems and map the cross- dependencies of those systems. Prioritize the continuity of the systems with highest impact. Æ Consolidate the monitoring and analysis of cyber incidents to a centralized body for government wide situational awarenesses and rapid mitigation and response of the incidents. Æ Ensure that there is a sustainable and continuous budget for investment in cybersecurity to reduce the risk in the fast-paced threat environment.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document emphasizes the importance of integrating cybersecurity into the foundation of a state's digital infrastructure, highlighting the inevitability of cyber threats and the need for resilience. It advocates for proactive measures such as real-time threat intelligence sharing, leveraging advanced technologies like AI, and securing data integrity to protect against both external and internal threats. Key recommendations include enforcing cybersecurity standards, prioritizing critical systems, and ensuring sustainable investment in cybersecurity.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Cyber defense must be a national priority due to the digital nature of critical infrastructure.\n- Investments in cybersecurity should be implemented from the inception of digital systems.\n- Real-time threat intelligence sharing is crucial for effective cyber incident response.\n- Data integrity must be prioritized to prevent unauthorized changes within the digital state.\n- A sustainable budget for cybersecurity is essential to mitigate risks in a fast-paced threat environment.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity strategies, Digital infrastructure, Threat intelligence, Data integrity, National security",

Strengthen collaboration with research institutions and reliable partners to continually refine and update protective standards, thereby effectively addressing emerging and future threats. Æ Appoint an organization that is responsible for cybersecurity within the country with executive power for all abovementioned points. 24 04 ENSURE WIDESPREAD AFFORDABLE ACCESS AND REDUNDANCY TO CONNECTIVITY Any loss of connectivity during a crisis implies that people are effectively cut off from the state and its services. In today’s digital age, access to the internet is as crucial for people as access to basic infrastructure and amenities. Several countries – such as Finland and Estonia – have implemented policies that declare connectivity as a basic infrastructure need (or even as a human right) and having declared it a national priority to provide every citizen with broadband access. These countries also show good correlation between connectivity and general level of digitalization. Connectivity must, therefore, be both widespread and resilient, resistant to tampering and adversarial interference. States must aim to improve access and coverage to the internet across their territory and, where possible, create free public access points such as in schools, libraries, and other key locations. Free market and competition should be assured to lower the cost of connectivity and increase the number of options. Countries can create incentives, subsidies, tax exceptions, license-free breaks, etc., for new telecommunications companies entering the local market to increase competition. With widespread and affordable broadband, states can even consider providing a limited free 4G/5G option that can only be utilized to access select services (news, public services, etc.), with the rationale of shifting costs from helpdesks and front offices to digital services. Building redundancy in connectivity is critical to assure resilience in crisis situations. During times of conflict, the infrastructure of the internet itself may be called into question, and undersea cables are vulnerable to sabotage and destruction. States must consider this and invest, where possible, into new and emerging communication technologies. For example, this may include adopting satellite communication programs that help overcome disruptions to traditional internet connectivity methods. To further increase resilience during crises, interoperability should be forced to network providers through regulation. Cross-border interoperability further enhances resilience. The state would assure the required agreements between the telecommunication providers. This approach has been best exemplified by Ukraine.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document emphasizes the importance of allocating at least 10% of the IT budget to cybersecurity and enhancing national capabilities in this domain. It also highlights the necessity of ensuring widespread, affordable, and resilient internet connectivity, treating it as a basic infrastructure need.

    "content": "Shortly days after the Russian invasion began in Ukraine in 2022, the country’s three main cellular operators activated a free roaming service between their respective networks [23]. If a user’s mobile network signal becomes unavailable, they are advised to try one of the other two providers. 25 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish a government function (e.g. National Connectivity Board) with direct mandate for: Æ Assure that affordable connectivity options exist for everybody. Consider having connectivity as a form of “human right”. Æ Conduct risk analysis on existing national connectivity options and introduce strategic diversification of connectivity types. Æ Exercise national digital infrastructure continuity in reduced connectivity scenarios. Implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure that critical systems remain operational during network disruptions. Æ Lower the cost of connectivity either through subsidies and incentives for new telecommunication providers or through direct benefits to end-users. Æ Create interoperability between telecommunication providers. Figure: undersea cables connect the digital world together, but are also vulnerable to sabotage. States must develop resilience in connectivity through multiple technology options. 26 05 BUILD REDUNDANCY TO DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE The extent to which modern societies rely on digital registries and public digital infrastructure is enormous. Most government databases are digital and, in the case of nations such as Estonia, so are almost all public services. Destruction or hostile control of just a few key critical registries or infrastructure facilities hosting them could send a government into turmoil. A key weakness of digital states is that, fundamentally, their digital data and assets are based on territory in the physical world. If the location of these data are known then this location can be damaged or destroyed and if backups are not available this could deny a state the ability to provide critical services. Imagining a severe scenario, the resulting crisis could even damage the perceived legitimacy of the state itself. Additionally, in the case that key digital registries fall into the hands of an adversary, they could severely disrupt the state’s data assets by deleting individuals or companies from registers, changing property rights, or altering the state’s finances. For this reason, several governments have sought to establish a Plan B to prepare for a potentially catastrophic scenario where public data necessary for the state’s continuity and legitimacy can neither be tampered with nor destroyed in any circumstance. One well-known solution for this is the Estonian Data Embassy [24], where key government registries and digital assets are backed up and stored on the territory of another sovereign country.\n\n---\n## Summary\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian cellular operators enabled free roaming between networks to maintain connectivity. Key recommendations for government resilience include establishing a National Connectivity Board, ensuring affordable connectivity, and building redundancy in digital infrastructure. Estonia's Data Embassy is highlighted as a solution for safeguarding critical government data.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Ukrainian cellular operators activated free roaming shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion.\n- A National Connectivity Board is recommended to ensure affordable connectivity for all.\n- Governments are advised to establish redundancy in digital infrastructure to prevent disruptions.\n- Estonia uses a Data Embassy to back up key government registries in another country.\n- Interoperability between telecommunication providers is crucial for network resilience.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment resilience, Digital infrastructure, Connectivity options, Data security, Telecommunication interoperability",

    "content": "In the case of a catastrophe, the data stored in the Data Embassy can be utilized to restore the legitimate state of governance and assure that tampering has not occurred. When initially conceptualized, this strategy was logical. There were fewer systems, the dependencies were manageable, and the amount of data was significantly lower. More importantly, however, the perception of threat was short-term. It was assumed that a crisis would last a short time – days, weeks, or months perhaps, but not years. It is now clear that this thinking was optimistic. Today, digital systems are highly interconnected and complex, and any long- term solution would need to be capable of not only backing up data and systems to a sovereign territory but also operating them from there (or at least from other locations in the country). Instead of a state-wide archiving solution, it is even more important to develop a Digital Embassy. This solution would allow for the duplication of a sovereign cloud onto foreign territory and, if necessary, allow for a foreign digital state to operate its digital services from it. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the practical need for such a solution. When Kyiv was partially encircled in 2022, it became evident that Ukraine would face a dire situation if it lost access to is key digital 27 registries. Following the Estonian Data Embassy model, efforts were made to break out of the capital and move entire data centres into friendly countries for safekeeping and backup operations [25]. Soon, large cloud providers also followed, and by today it can be said that Ukraine’s digital continuity is assured by NATO countries and companies operating in NATO territories. This transition toward building a resilient and dynamic cloud environment will not be an easy task. States should start by prioritizing the transition to local or international clouds for critical public services and infrastructure first. This change will require broad legislative and regulatory support, from removing obstacles in the existing legislation to creating capabilities, particularly in terms of international cooperation. Figure: Integrations and data exchange of government systems in Estonia. Without a holistic approach to resilience, a single failing critical system could create a propagating cascading failure. 28 Figure: Phased transition to wider international alliances based on mutual trust and agreements. The locations on the map are for illustrative purposes only. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Establish national information system standards that mandates critical public services and infrastructure to become cloud-compatible over a specific time span. The standard shall establish mandatory requirements for all government system procurements and internal developments.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe concept of a Data Embassy, initially designed to restore governance in case of a catastrophe, has evolved due to the increasing complexity and interconnection of digital systems. The war in Ukraine demonstrated the need for resilient digital infrastructures, leading to the adoption of international cloud solutions to ensure digital continuity. To achieve this, countries must prioritize transitioning critical public services to cloud environments and establish supportive legislative frameworks.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Data Embassies were initially designed to restore governance quickly after a catastrophe.\n- The war in Ukraine highlighted the need for resilient digital infrastructures.\n- Ukraine's digital continuity is now supported by NATO countries and companies.\n- Transitioning to cloud environments requires legislative and regulatory support.\n- Establishing national standards for cloud compatibility is recommended for critical services.\n\n## Topics\nData Embassy, Digital Resilience, Cloud Solutions, International Cooperation, Legislative Support",

    "content": "Æ Assess the existing critical public services and infrastructure to identify gaps blocking the transition. Æ Work with multinational partners and regulators on assuring control and trust over cloud services. Æ Establish a national body (such as National Cloud Governance Centre) which would act as a single point of resource for cloud infrastructure, managing the market research, risk management, procurement, adoption, interoperability and minimum-security requirements for the entire government and providing incentives for all authorities for the transition. 29 06 MANAGE THE THIRD-PARTY RISK WHILE PRESERVING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION As the digital world is both globalizing and consolidating, third-party risk management is becoming a strategically critical capability. As much of the world’s technology stack relies on third-party components, a compromise to any part of the supply or dependency chain can cause significant damage. Only by assuring the safety and compliance of the entire chain in its depth, could the results be deemed safe. One recent example of a successful supply chain attack was the compromise of SolarWinds, significantly impacting the national security of the United States [26]. Managing third-party risk is hard, and it will get harder. It will require states to be able to make strategic choices about the software and hardware they procure and also develop the capability to have a constant awareness of the current state of the digital global supply chain. While the security and compliance of a limited number of hardware and software products can be assessed to be safe, assuring compliance for all public digital services and infrastructure development and its dependencies in full risk depth is likely too much for any regulator. Depending on a state and its position toward the global community, they might address these challenges differently. For example, a weighted-risk approach could be chosen where a risk-tolerant strategy could be followed, dependent on the criticality of the subject service. This approach would ensure that critical systems would receive proportionately higher compliance requirements, whereas non-critical systems could either be audited at a lower level or require only voluntary compliance. However, not all risks can be fully mitigated. Most states are dependent on foreign technologies that have little or no alternatives. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is one example of a cornerstone technology for many modern services with limited competition and low adoption of these alternatives. While larger states may be able to develop their own operating systems, they will almost always rely on third- party components, and even then, it would almost certainly not be a cost-effective use of resources.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of managing third-party risks in the digital supply chain, especially as it relates to critical public services and infrastructure. It suggests establishing a national body to oversee cloud infrastructure and emphasizes the need for strategic choices in software and hardware procurement. The text also highlights the challenges of ensuring compliance and security across all digital services, noting the reliance on foreign technologies like GPS.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The document proposes establishing a National Cloud Governance Centre to manage cloud infrastructure for the government.\n- Managing third-party risk is crucial due to the global and consolidated nature of the digital world.\n- The SolarWinds attack is cited as an example of a significant supply chain compromise affecting national security.\n- A weighted-risk approach is suggested for managing compliance based on the criticality of services.\n- States often depend on foreign technologies, such as GPS, which have limited alternatives.\n\n## Topics\nThird-party risk, Cloud infrastructure, Supply chain security, Foreign technology dependency",

    "content": "Instead, regulators are now working to develop long-term SLAs that force compliance with domestic requirements. 30 In the broader sense, the key challenge to third-party risk management lies in finding the balance between openness and fostering innovation with regulation and ensuring risk mitigation. To counter the risk of limiting innovation, a risk-tolerant fallback strategy should be utilized. For example, AI tools are mostly cloud-based and incorporating them into a digital state’s operations could potentially create a “black box” dependency. However, following a risk-tolerant approach, instead of banning the external dependency from the service, it could instead be introduced as a switchable feature, which could be turned off at any point. This might downgrade the service experience for the end-user, but it would ultimately not cause the service to fail entirely in case of interruptions with dependencies. 31 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Establish a nationwide risk management policy to manage third-party risks. This policy shall establish rules on which systems can or cannot use what kind of proprietary technologies and if a more comprehensive system must be capable of operating in an emergency mode also independently of said technologies. These rules shall be minimal enough to be practical, implementable, and easily auditable. Æ Enforce the policy and rules for third-party risk management of most common technology and security standards through a central authority. This central authority shall build the capability to monitor and react to changes in the supply chain and find optimal cost-to-risk ratio alternatives. Æ Establish an audit authority for critical public services and infrastructure to comply with the established policy. Æ Exercise the resilience to third-party risks while testing and auditing relevant aspects in the policy. Æ Work with multinational regulators to manage third-party risk globally and share the knowledge with partners in like-minded nations. 32 07 CREATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE Government resilience and plans for the continuity of the state are broad concepts, involving in some ways most if not all functions of the government. Considering scalability, each government function or service should be responsible for their own resilience, creating a de-centralized approach to resilience. This encompasses both specific plans and changes, but also broader increase in the maturity across several disciplines required for the operation of digital services. A recommended approach is to appoint a dedicated advisor in government organizations to develop resilience plans and coordinate with other government bodies and private sector partners.\n\n---\n## Summary\nRegulators are focusing on developing long-term Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure compliance with domestic requirements while balancing innovation and risk mitigation. A risk-tolerant fallback strategy is suggested to manage third-party risks, particularly with AI tools, by allowing for switchable features that can be turned off if necessary. Key recommendations include establishing a nationwide risk management policy, enforcing third-party risk management rules, and creating institutional capacity for government resilience.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Regulators aim to develop long-term SLAs for compliance with domestic requirements.\n- A risk-tolerant fallback strategy is recommended for managing third-party risks.\n- AI tools pose a risk of creating 'black box' dependencies in digital operations.\n- A nationwide risk management policy is advised to handle third-party risks.\n- Institutional capacity for government resilience should be developed with decentralized responsibility.\n\n## Topics\nThird-party risk management, Government resilience, AI tools dependency, Risk management policy",

    "content": "However, to mitigate the risks of cascading failures, and managing the practical reality of coordinating with large number government authorities, an additional top-down approach is recommended. To see a whole- of-government policy through execution, typically requires creation of a vertical that has necessary executive power and long-term commitment. For that end, we recommend governments establishment of a vertical body that is responsible for overseeing, coordinating and achieving outcomes that directly relate to increasing government resilience and continuity of the state. That unit should be well-placed in the government power structure to be effective in execution, for example under the State Secretary Office or a similar centralized function. The unit would be responsible for: 1. Owning end-to-end crisis plans across all government. 2. Analysing cross-dependencies for cascade failures and eliminating them. 3. Running government resilience exercises and auditing government organizations for their resilience. 4. Building crisis management competence. 5. Executing crisis management coordination during a crisis with vertical power structure. 6. Policy analysis and coordinating necessary regulative changes. 33 EXAMPLE OF A GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE EXERCISE. Æ In an example scenario of a State Announcements Service, all employees are forced to work remotely. The building is sealed off and powered down, simulating a severe crisis scenario. At the same time, an artificial peak of service load is created, simulating people who are now accessing the service due to the nature of the crisis. To make matters both worse and realistic, the service is also under an extreme cyberattack, further denying access. In an ideal but also achievable outcome, there are minimal to no service interruptions for the citizen. 34 The future resilient digital state utilizes the digital domain to ensure its continuity. It is fully digitalized and demonstrates geographical location independence for its core digital services. How a specific state achieves this goal will depend on their respective context but will certainly involve positioning at least part of their core digital infrastructure outside of their territorial border. It also places significant demands on the state’s capabilities, as ensuring digital operations requires a level of maturity and coordination likely higher than currently exists. The above recommendations are offered from the perspective of developing increasingly resilient digital states. However, these recommendations should not only be viewed from a lens of helping states overcome crises. Instead, they can also be understood as an acknowledgement of the future trajectory that the world is facing. Emerging digital technologies are reshaping our world and the way that we exist within it, states are not immune from this change.\n\n---\n## Summary\nTo enhance government resilience and manage risks of cascading failures, a top-down approach is recommended, involving the creation of a vertical body with executive power. This body would oversee crisis management, analyze dependencies, and ensure continuity of services during crises. The future digital state must be resilient, utilizing digital infrastructure that may extend beyond territorial borders to ensure service continuity.\n\n## Key Facts\n- A vertical body with executive power is recommended to oversee government resilience.\n- This body should be placed under a centralized function like the State Secretary Office.\n- Responsibilities include crisis plan ownership, resilience exercises, and policy analysis.\n- A government resilience exercise example involves remote work and simulated cyberattacks.\n- Future digital states need infrastructure beyond borders for service continuity.\n\n## Topics\nGovernment resilience, Crisis management, Digital infrastructure, Policy coordination, Cascading failures",

    "content": "Failing to digitalize, states will not be able to effectively manage the growing number and complexity of crises they will face in the years ahead. As digital and emerging technologies like AI continue to reshape our world, states must also show their willingness to adapt. THE FUTURE OF RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES 35 Key to this adaptation will be a state’s ability to integrate digital technology into their understanding of the state itself. There is also substantial opportunity for the international community to update the way in which they think about emergent digital states. What might it look like if a state loses sovereignty over its territory due to conflict, or if its territory disappears due to a natural disaster or another crisis? What would it mean if a state was able to maintain its public services, national identity, and democratic system of government via virtual means? These digital states represent a potential future where governance, culture, and community are not necessarily defined only by the territory where an individual is born but by their participation and contribution in the digital realm as well. This is not an abstract thought experiment, but a call to action to the international community to take this issue seriously. These are issues that the world will have to confront in the near term as some states are already on track to watch their physical territory disappear due to rising sea levels. This is just one example, but there are many more and they are likely to continue to occur in the years ahead. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. D.

    "content": "Yet, recent incidents and escalating geopolitical tensions demonstrate that the threat has only intensified. A 2023 report by HFW and CyberOwl revealed that the average ransom payment demanded in the maritime sector has soared to €2.76 million, with the total cost of an attack averaging €473,790. In response, a new wave of regulations is moving from guidance to mandate, fundamentally altering the risk landscape for port operators and their executive leadership. The European Union’s updated Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) and the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements (UR E26/E27) for new vessels impose stringent technical and procedural security measures. Critically, these regulations introduce direct accountability for senior management, with non-compliance penalties reaching as high as €10 million or 2 % of a company’s global annual turnover. Navigating the digital current: Building cyber resilience in the ports of tomorrow 4 This report moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar strategic framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience. It argues that a modern, defensible posture must be built upon: Resilient by Design architecture: Adopting a Zero Trust security philosophy to secure the converged IT/OT environment, guided, but not limited by proven industrial frameworks like the Purdue model for network segmentation and IEC 62443 for risk-based controls. Defensible supply chains: Proactively managing the significant risks introduced by third-party vendors, software suppliers, and the vast ecosystem of connected hardware, from cranes to IoT sensors. A culture of active defence: Embedding cybersecurity into the organisation’s DNA through engaged executive governance, advanced and continuous workforce training, and the development of OT-specific incident response capabilities. Cybersecurity is no longer a back-office IT function or a mere cost centre; it is a core component of operational infrastructure and a crucial element of business continuity. For port leadership, it represents both a significant risk to be managed and an opportunity to build a competitive advantage through enhanced reliability and trust. This report provides an actionable roadmap for navigating this complex new reality, guiding the maritime industry from a state of reactive risk to one of strategic, verifiable resilience. 5 The new tide of risk: The hyper-connected maritime ecosystem The modern port is a marvel of logistical efficiency, a hyper-connected ecosystem where the digital and physical worlds converge. This transformation, while essential for global trade, has fundamentally altered the sector’s risk profile.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe maritime sector is facing increased cyber threats, with ransom demands averaging €2.76 million and attack costs around €473,790. New regulations like the EU's NIS2 and IACS's UR E26/E27 are enforcing stringent cybersecurity measures, holding senior management accountable with penalties up to €10 million. A strategic framework for cyber resilience includes resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defense, positioning cybersecurity as a core operational component.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Average ransom payment in the maritime sector is €2.76 million.\n- Total cost of a cyber attack in the maritime industry averages €473,790.\n- EU's NIS2 and IACS UR E26/E27 regulations impose strict cybersecurity measures.\n- Non-compliance penalties can reach €10 million or 2% of global turnover.\n- Cybersecurity is now a core component of operational infrastructure in ports.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Regulatory compliance, Cyber resilience, Port operations, Risk management",

    "content": "The traditional, siloed view of security is obsolete, replaced by a complex, blended threat landscape where a single digital vulnerability can trigger a cascade of physical and financial consequences. Understanding this new reality—the interconnected nature of port technology, the motivations of those who target it, and the staggering financial and operational costs of failure is the first step toward building genuine resilience. The digital port: An ecosystem of interconnected risk Today’s port environment is a complex “system of systems.” Corporate Information Technology (IT) networks, which manage logistics platforms, scheduling, and financial transactions, are now deeply integrated with Operational Technology (OT) systems, the industrial control systems (ICS), SCADA platforms, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that command the physical world of cranes, gates, and fuel pumps. This convergence is further complicated by the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and/or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices and sensors, and the nascent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for optimising schedules and enabling autonomous vehicles. This drive for efficiency has created a seamless flow of data, but it has also erased the traditional air gaps and security perimeters that once isolated critical operational machinery from the outside world. The attack surface has expanded exponentially, creating countless new entry points for adversaries. The U.S. Coast Guard’s 2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) report starkly illustrates this new reality, noting that advances in satellite communications have forged direct links between shipboard systems and corporate networks. This connectivity enables malware to spread rapidly from a compromised shore-based office to vessels at sea, turning a corporate IT issue into a critical maritime safety incident. The digital port is no longer a collection of discrete systems; it is a single, interconnected ecosystem of efficiency, risk and opportunity. 5 6 The motivations for attacking this critical infrastructure are as diverse as the actors themselves. Port operators face a multi-faceted threat landscape composed of distinct but often overlapping groups: State-sponsored groups: • Nations leverage cyber capabilities as an instrument of power. Groups such as Russia’s APT28 (Fancy Bear) and Sandworm, China’s APT40, and Iran’s Imperial Kitten target maritime infrastructure for geopolitical disruption, economic espionage, and the theft of sensitive intellectual property, such as advanced port and naval technology, to support their own military and economic ambitions.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe modern port environment is a complex, interconnected system where digital vulnerabilities can lead to significant physical and financial impacts. The integration of IT and OT systems, along with IoT and AI technologies, has expanded the attack surface, making ports more susceptible to cyber threats. State-sponsored groups are among the diverse actors targeting maritime infrastructure for geopolitical and economic gains.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The traditional security approach is obsolete due to interconnected digital vulnerabilities.\n- Port environments integrate IT and OT systems, increasing cyber risk.\n- IoT and AI adoption in ports has expanded the attack surface.\n- The U.S. Coast Guard highlights risks from satellite communication links between ships and corporate networks.\n- State-sponsored groups like Russia's APT28 target maritime infrastructure for geopolitical reasons.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Port technology integration, Cyber threat landscape, State-sponsored cyber attacks",

    "content": "Hacktivist groups: • Ideologically or politically motivated groups like the pro-Russian Killnet and Noname057 use less sophisticated but highly disruptive tactics, primarily distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Their goal is not financial gain but to make a political statement, disrupt the operations of perceived adversaries, and garner media attention. Attacks on European ports have been explicitly linked to efforts to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Cybercriminal organisations: • These financially motivated syndicates, including notorious ransomware gangs like LockBit and CLOP, view ports as high-value targets. They understand that operational downtime is immensely costly, creating powerful leverage for extortion. By encrypting critical systems or stealing and threatening to leak sensitive data, they paralyse operations and force organisations into making multi-million-dollar ransom payments. A critical point of understanding for port leadership is that these categories are not mutually exclusive. The lines between state-sponsored activity and cybercrime are increasingly blurred, creating a more complex and dangerous threat environment. A seemingly standard ransomware attack from a criminal group could, in fact, be a state-sponsored operation designed to probe defences, cause disruption, or create a persistent backdoor for future espionage, all under the guise of a simple shakedown. Similarly, the disruptive actions of hacktivist groups often align perfectly with the geopolitical objectives of their state benefactors. This potential for a geopolitical-criminal nexus elevates the threat from a purely financial risk to a matter of national and economic security, requiring a far more strategic and robust defensive posture. Who is attacking ports and why? 6 7 The consequences of a successful cyber-attack on a port are not abstract; they are concrete, immediate, and financially devastating. To make sound investment decisions, leadership must grasp the full spectrum of potential costs. Direct financial costs: The most visible costs are the ransoms paid and the expenses for remediation. A 2023 report from HFW and CyberOwl found the average ransom payment in the maritime sector has reached €2.76 million, with the average total cost of an attack, including remediation and initial disruption, hitting €473,790. These figures, however, are dwarfed by the costs of major incidents. The 2017 NotPetya attack, which was not even targeted at Maersk but hit the shipping giant as collateral damage, resulted in losses estimated between €172 million and €258 million.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the threat posed by hacktivist groups and cybercriminal organizations to maritime ports, highlighting the use of DDoS attacks and ransomware to disrupt operations and extort money. It emphasizes the blurred lines between state-sponsored cyber activities and criminal operations, which elevate the threat to national and economic security. The financial impact of such attacks is significant, with average ransom payments in the maritime sector reaching €2.76 million, and major incidents like the NotPetya attack causing losses up to €258 million.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Hacktivist groups like Killnet use DDoS attacks to disrupt operations and make political statements.\n- Cybercriminal organizations target ports for financial gain, using ransomware to extort multi-million-euro payments.\n- The average ransom payment in the maritime sector is €2.76 million, with total attack costs averaging €473,790.\n- The 2017 NotPetya attack caused losses for Maersk estimated between €172 million and €258 million.\n- State-sponsored activities and cybercrime are increasingly intertwined, posing complex security threats.\n\n## Topics\nHacktivist groups, Cybercriminal organizations, Ransomware attacks, Maritime sector security, State-sponsored cyber activities",

    "content": "Operational costs of downtime: For a port, time is money on a massive scale. Every hour that cranes are idle, ships are unable to dock, and trucks cannot move cargo translates into direct revenue loss. One large port in the United Kingdom estimated its downtime cost to be €200,000 per hour. Broader industry studies reinforce this, with Gartner estimating the average cost of IT downtime at €4824 per minute, and other reports placing the figure for large enterprises at over €860,00 million per hour. The physical blockage of the Suez canal by the container ship Ever Given in 2021 provides a powerful analogue for the potential impact of a cyber-induced operational shutdown at a critical chokepoint, with estimates of the cost to global trade reaching nearly €8 billion per day. Systemic and uninsurable risk: The interconnected nature of global shipping means that a localised attack can have systemic consequences. A landmark study by the University of Cambridge, modelling a hypothetical “Shen attack,” projected that a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region could trigger an economic loss of €95 billion. Critically, the study concluded that the vast majority of this loss would fall into an insurance gap, highlighting the potential for catastrophic, uninsurable risk that threatens the stability of the entire global economy. Reputational and legal costs: Beyond the immediate financial bleed, a cyber-attack inflicts long-term damage to an organisation’s reputation and can trigger severe legal and regulatory penalties. The 2018 data breach at British Airways, for example, resulted not only in a €23 million fine from regulators but also a potential €2.75 billion class-action settlement and a four-year low in the company’s public reputation score. In an industry built on trust and reliability, such damage can be difficult and costly to repair. The bottom line: Quantifying the crippling cost of an attack 8 Despite the clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within the maritime industry’s leadership. There is a marked disconnect between perceived preparedness and the harsh operational reality. This is not merely a technical issue; it is a strategic blind spot that represents one of the sector’s greatest vulnerabilities. Evidence of this disconnect is compelling.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe maritime industry faces significant financial risks from operational downtime and cyber-attacks, with potential costs reaching millions per hour. A cyber-attack on major ports could lead to catastrophic economic losses, largely uninsurable, threatening global economic stability. Additionally, cyber incidents can severely damage reputations and lead to costly legal consequences, highlighting a strategic vulnerability within the industry.\n\n## Key Facts\n- A UK port estimates downtime costs at €200,000 per hour.\n- Gartner estimates IT downtime costs at €4824 per minute.\n- A cyber-attack on 15 major Asia-Pacific ports could cause €95 billion in economic losses.\n- The Ever Given blockage cost global trade nearly €8 billion per day.\n- British Airways faced a €23 million fine and a potential €2.75 billion settlement after a data breach.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Operational downtime costs, Economic impact, Reputational damage, Cyber-attack risks",

    "content": "A 2022 survey by law firm Jones Walker found that while an overwhelming 90 % of port and terminal executives felt “very confident” in their overall cybersecurity posture, a staggering 45 % of those same respondents admitted their organisation had suffered a breach within the past year. This confidence is further undermined by investment levels that are starkly misaligned with the scale of the risk. The HFW/CyberOwl report revealed that a third of shipping organisations spend less than €86,000 annually on cybersecurity, a fraction of a single potential ransom payment. This gap extends from strategy to technical understanding. The 2024 USCG CTIME report discovered that more than half of the maritime organisations it assessed held fundamentally inaccurate assumptions about their own network architecture. Many believed their critical OT networks were safely “air-gapped” or isolated from IT networks and the internet. In reality, the assessments frequently proved otherwise, uncovering unrecognised and unmonitored connections that exposed their most critical physical processes to attack. The conclusion is unavoidable: the primary challenge in maritime cybersecurity is not a lack of technology, but a lack of strategic alignment. Overconfidence, underinvestment, and a flawed understanding of the converged IT/OT environment have created a fertile ground for adversaries. To move forward, the industry must close this perception gap and treat cyber resilience not as an IT compliance task, but as a fundamental pillar of strategic risk management and business continuity. The strategic disconnect: Confidence vs. reality 9 per hour is the estimated downtime cost by one large port in UK. € 200k of port and terminal executives when asked for a 2022 survey felt “very confident” in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering .. 90 % could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region. € 95 B of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach the year before. 45 % 9 10 Anatomy of a port shutdown: A multi-vector threat analysis To build an effective defence, port leadership must understand not just the individual threats they face, but how adversaries combine them into sophisticated, multi-vector campaigns designed to cause maximum disruption. By clustering common threats into three core themes: Exploiting the human element Weaponising digital infrastructure Compromising physical operations We can better appreciate the anatomy of a modern port attack and the cascading nature of cyber risk.\n\n---\n## Summary\nA 2022 survey by Jones Walker revealed a significant gap between the confidence of port and terminal executives in their cybersecurity and the reality of frequent breaches. Many maritime organizations underinvest in cybersecurity, with a third spending less than €86,000 annually, and often have inaccurate assumptions about their network security. The industry must shift from viewing cybersecurity as an IT compliance issue to a strategic risk management imperative to address these vulnerabilities effectively.\n\n## Key Facts\n- 90% of port and terminal executives felt confident in their cybersecurity, yet 45% experienced breaches.\n- A third of shipping organizations spend less than €86,000 annually on cybersecurity.\n- The 2024 USCG CTIME report found many maritime organizations had inaccurate network security assumptions.\n- Maritime cybersecurity issues stem from overconfidence, underinvestment, and flawed IT/OT understanding.\n- Cyber resilience should be treated as a strategic risk management issue, not just IT compliance.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Cyber risk management, IT/OT convergence, Cybersecurity investment, Port security breaches",

    "content": "01 02 03 11 The most fortified digital defences can be rendered useless by a single, well-placed click. Attacks targeting the human element remain the most common and effective way for adversaries to gain an initial foothold, as they bypass technical controls by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of human psychology: trust, urgency, and fallibility. This category encompasses two deeply related threat types: phishing and social engineering and insider threats and unauthorised access. The cautionary tale of a port administrator opening a seemingly routine email from a logistics partner is a scenario played out daily across the industry. The branding is flawless, the tone is urgent, and the request seems legitimate. Yet, that single click can unleash malware that cripples cargo tracking systems and brings operations to a halt. According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), the speed of this compromise is alarming: the median time from a user opening a malicious email to clicking a link is just 21 seconds, with data entry occurring only 28 seconds later. In less than a minute, an attacker can be inside the network. Phishing remains the most prevalent entry point for attacks in the maritime sector. Tactics range from mass-produced emails with malicious attachments disguised as invoices to highly targeted “spear-phishing” campaigns that use meticulously researched details to build credibility. These are often paired with social engineering, such as a follow-up phone call from someone convincingly impersonating an IT support technician to acquire login credentials. This vector directly enables the second threat: unauthorised access and insider threats. The 2011 incident in Antwerp, where a drug cartel worked with hackers to infiltrate the port’s IT systems, is a stark example. By sending malware-laced emails to port staff, they harvested credentials that allowed them to track and intercept containers filled with cocaine. The operation was facilitated by complicit insiders who helped maintain access and evade detection. An insider threat is not always malicious; it can be an unintentional act by a negligent employee who falls for a phishing scam or a third-party contractor who is given excessive access privileges. The 2021 cyber-attack against the Port of Houston was reportedly initiated via credentials compromised from a third-party provider, perfectly illustrating the dangerous intersection of human error, insider access, and supply chain risk. The impacts of these human-centric attacks are severe.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe maritime industry faces significant cybersecurity threats, primarily due to human vulnerabilities exploited through phishing and social engineering tactics. These attacks often lead to unauthorized access and insider threats, as demonstrated by incidents like the 2011 Antwerp port infiltration and the 2021 Port of Houston cyber-attack. The speed and effectiveness of these attacks highlight the critical need for robust security measures addressing both technical and human factors.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Phishing is the most common entry point for cyber-attacks in the maritime sector.\n- The median time from opening a malicious email to clicking a link is just 21 seconds.\n- The 2011 Antwerp incident involved hackers and insiders facilitating drug smuggling via IT system infiltration.\n- The 2021 Port of Houston attack was initiated through compromised third-party credentials.\n- Human error and insider threats significantly increase cybersecurity risks in maritime operations.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Phishing attacks, Insider threats, Social engineering, Supply chain risk",

    "content": "They can lead to the complete compromise of Port Management Systems and Terminal Operating Systems (TOS), allowing attackers to manipulate cargo records, disrupt logistics, and interfere with operational technology. They result in data breaches of sensitive manifests and financial records, which can be sold or used for corporate espionage. Most dangerously, as the Antwerp case shows, they can turn the port’s own digital systems into a tool for facilitating large-scale physical crime. 01 0 The human element: Exploiting trust to open the gates 12 Once an attacker gains initial access—often through human exploitation—they can begin to weaponise the port’s own digital infrastructure against it. This phase of an attack focuses on escalating access, deploying malicious payloads, and leveraging the port’s reliance on technology to disrupt operations and extort payment. This theme combines the threats of ransomware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and malware and supply chain attacks. Ransomware has surged to become the preeminent financial threat to the maritime industry, involved in an estimated 69 % of cyberattacks on ports between 2011 and 2023. The 2017 NotPetya attack on Maersk, which shut down 17 terminals globally, was a wake-up call, but the threat has since evolved. Modern ransomware attacks, like the one by the LockBit group that paralysed Japan’s Port of Nagoya in July 2023, now employ a “double extortion” model. Attackers not only encrypt critical systems and demand a cryptocurrency payment for the decryption key, but they also steal vast amounts of sensitive data beforehand. This gives them a second point of leverage: if the ransom is not paid, they threaten to release the stolen data on the dark web. The 2024 Verizon DBIR confirms that ransomware and other extortion techniques now account for roughly one- third of all breaches across industries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks represent a different form of digital weaponisation, focused on paralysis rather than penetration. As described in the scenario of a DDoS assault on a smart port, attackers don’t need to breach a system; they simply overwhelm it with a flood of malicious traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCyberattacks on maritime infrastructure, such as ports, can lead to significant disruptions in logistics and operations by compromising digital systems. These attacks often exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access and employ methods like ransomware and DDoS attacks to extort payments and disrupt services. The maritime industry has seen a rise in ransomware attacks, with a notable shift towards a 'double extortion' model, where data is both encrypted and stolen for leverage.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Ransomware attacks accounted for 69% of cyberattacks on ports between 2011 and 2023.\n- The 2017 NotPetya attack on Maersk shut down 17 terminals globally.\n- The LockBit ransomware group attacked Japan’s Port of Nagoya in July 2023 using a 'double extortion' model.\n- Ransomware and extortion techniques account for one-third of all breaches across industries, according to the 2024 Verizon DBIR.\n- DDoS attacks focus on overwhelming systems with traffic, making them inaccessible without breaching them.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cyberattacks, Port security threats, Ransomware in ports, DDoS attacks, Cyber extortion",

    "content": "This is achieved through various methods, including volumetric floods that saturate network bandwidth, protocol attacks (like SYN floods) that exhaust the connection capacity of firewalls and VPN gateways, and sophisticated application-layer (Layer 7) attacks that target the logic of critical APIs for customs or cargo tracking. In the just-in-time world of port logistics, this forced downtime is damage enough, crippling operations and causing immediate financial backlogs. Malware and supply chain attacks act as a force multiplier for these threats, providing a stealthy and effective delivery mechanism. Instead of a frontal assault, attackers compromise a trusted third party, such as a software vendor or maintenance contractor. Malicious code is hidden within a legitimate software update, or stolen vendor credentials are used to abuse trusted remote access channels. The 2024 Verizon DBIR highlights a 68 % year-over-year increase in breaches involving a third party, often driven by the exploitation of vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware. Once inside, the malware can harvest credentials, manipulate customs records, or lie dormant until activated to launch a wider ransomware attack. The combined impact of these weaponised digital attacks is catastrophic. They can lead to a complete operational shutdown, with cargo handling systems disabled, logistics platforms failing, and communication systems crippled. The result is a cascade of delays, severe financial losses from both the disruption and potential extortion payments, and significant damage to the port’s reputation for reliability. 02 The weaponisation of digital infrastructure: From disruption to extortion 13 The most dangerous maritime cyber threats are those that cross the divide from the digital to the physical world, turning malicious code into kinetic impact. These attacks target the Operational Technology (OT) at the heart of the port, manipulating the machinery that moves cargo, manages infrastructure, and ensures safety. This represents a convergence of three advanced threat vectors: SCADA/ICS sabotage, the exploitation of the IoT attack surface, and the manipulation of AI systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems (ICS) are the nerve centres of a port’s physical operations. An attack on these systems, such as a sabotage scenario where a port’s automated crane system freezes mid-operation, can have immediate and devastating consequences. The core vulnerabilities of these systems are well-known and systemic. Many ports rely on legacy OT assets running software that is decades old, can no longer be patched, and was never designed with internet connectivity in mind.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the increasing threat of cyberattacks on maritime infrastructure, highlighting methods such as volumetric floods, protocol attacks, and application-layer attacks. It emphasizes the role of third-party breaches in facilitating these attacks and the catastrophic impact on port operations, including financial losses and reputational damage. Additionally, it explores the convergence of digital and physical threats, particularly targeting operational technology like SCADA and ICS systems.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Volumetric floods and protocol attacks are used to disrupt maritime networks.\n- The 2024 Verizon DBIR reports a 68% increase in breaches involving third parties.\n- Malware can manipulate customs records or launch ransomware attacks.\n- Cyberattacks can lead to operational shutdowns and severe financial losses.\n- Legacy OT systems in ports are vulnerable due to outdated software.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cyber threats, Operational technology, Third-party breaches, Ransomware attacks, Port logistics security",

    "content": "They often use weak or hard-coded default credentials (e.g., “admin/ admin”) and communicate using unencrypted protocols, allowing attackers to intercept and spoof commands. The most critical vulnerability, however, is the lack of strict network segmentation between IT and OT environments. The USCG CTIME report validates this widespread issue, finding that a majority of assessed organisations had flawed assumptions about their IT/OT separation, creating a direct path for an attacker to pivot from a compromised corporate email account to the controls of a ship-to-shore crane. The Internet of Things (IoT) attack surface massively compounds this risk. A smart port is a dense web of thousands of connected devices, smart sensors on refrigerated containers, CCTV cameras, RFID readers, and automated vehicle controls. These devices are a security nightmare: they are often mass-produced with minimal security, deployed with insecure default configurations that are never changed, and lack any mechanism for remote patching or firmware updates. As such, a single compromised IoT sensor on a flat, unsegmented network can serve as the perfect beachhead for an attacker. From there, they can conduct surveillance, gather intelligence on cargo movements, or pivot into the core OT network to launch a more destructive attack. This risk is amplified by a heavy reliance on foreign- manufactured equipment, such as ZPMC cranes, which introduce concerns regarding embedded backdoors and supply chain vulnerabilities at a national security level. 03 The compromise of physical operations: Crossing the cyber-physical divide 14 Artificial Intelligence (AI) manipulation represents the next frontier of cyber-physical attacks. As ports adopt AI for logistics optimisation, predictive maintenance, and autonomous systems, they open themselves to a new class of threats that target the logic of the system itself. These are not simple shutdown attacks; they are subtle and insidious manipulations. Key vectors include: Adversarial attacks: Tricking an AI’s perception model. For example, a strategically placed sticker on a container could cause an AI-driven crane’s camera to misread its destination, facilitating theft or causing logistical chaos. Data poisoning: Intentionally feeding malicious or biased data into an AI’s training set. This could teach a predictive maintenance model to ignore the signs of impending critical failure or train a security surveillance system not to recognise a specific type of threat. Model extraction: Repeatedly querying a model to reverse-engineer its logic or extract sensitive information from its training data, effectively stealing the port’s operational intelligence.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document highlights significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities in maritime operations, particularly due to weak credentials, unsegmented IT/OT networks, and insecure IoT devices. It also discusses the emerging threats posed by AI manipulation, which can disrupt logistics and operations through adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model extraction. These vulnerabilities and threats pose serious risks to both operational integrity and national security.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Weak or hard-coded default credentials are commonly used, making systems vulnerable to attacks.\n- Lack of strict network segmentation between IT and OT environments allows attackers to pivot from compromised systems to operational controls.\n- IoT devices in ports are often insecure, with default configurations and no remote patching capabilities, increasing attack risks.\n- AI manipulation in ports can lead to logistical chaos through adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model extraction.\n- Foreign-manufactured equipment introduces additional supply chain vulnerabilities and national security concerns.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities, Maritime operations, AI manipulation, IoT security, Network segmentation",

    "content": "These three vectors, SCADA, IoT, and AI, should not be viewed in isolation. Their true danger lies in how they can be chained together in a catastrophic attack sequence. An adversary could begin with a simple phishing email to steal credentials from a maintenance vendor (exploiting the human element). Using these credentials, they could access the network through an insecure remote connection (weaponising digital infrastructure). Discovering a flat network, they could then pivot from the IT environment directly into the OT zone. There, they could launch a sabotage attack against a legacy SCADA system to halt crane operations while simultaneously hijacking an insecure IoT camera to monitor the port’s physical response. To maximise the chaos, they could have previously poisoned the training data of an AI-powered logistics scheduler, causing it to misroute containers and create gridlock during the physical shutdown. This blended, multi-domain assault, where a vulnerability in one area enables catastrophic failure in another, demonstrates why modern defence must be holistic and integrated, treating the entire IT/OT/AI ecosystem as a single, interconnected battlespace. 15 Nine ways your port could be attacked 16 In the summer of 2017, a container terminal in Rotterdam went dark. Computer monitors froze, cranes idled, and cargo ships waited adrift – an unlikely symptom of a digital virus. The culprit: NotPetya, a particularly virulent strain of malware that had infiltrated Maersk’s global operations, disabling terminals from Mumbai to Los Angeles. It was not a targeted strike but rather collateral damage from a cyberwar experiment gone awry in Ukraine. But for the world’s largest shipping conglomerate, it was a wake-up call: the age of cyber threats had come to port. Since then, ransomware has become the dominant threat facing maritime infrastructure. The mechanics of a ransomware attack are deceptively simple: attackers lock access to critical systems or data and demand payment, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid, the data may remain locked, be released but corrupted, or be deleted altogether. The logic is cruelly effective: disable the systems, disrupt the flow of goods, and force businesses to choose between paying up or facing costly standstills. More insidiously, some ransomware variants now steal data before encrypting it, doubling the leverage. In such cases, firms face not only operational paralysis but also the threat of having sensitive financial or cargo records dumped onto the dark web.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the interconnected vulnerabilities of SCADA, IoT, and AI systems in maritime operations, highlighting how these can be exploited in a coordinated cyberattack. It uses the example of the NotPetya malware attack on Maersk to illustrate the potential impact of cyber threats on global shipping operations. The rise of ransomware as a significant threat to maritime infrastructure is also emphasized, with attackers often demanding cryptocurrency payments to restore access to critical systems.\n\n## Key Facts\n- SCADA, IoT, and AI systems can be exploited together in cyberattacks on maritime operations.\n- The NotPetya malware attack in 2017 disrupted Maersk's global operations, affecting ports worldwide.\n- Ransomware attacks lock critical systems and demand cryptocurrency payments for decryption keys.\n- Some ransomware variants also steal data before encryption, increasing leverage over victims.\n- Modern defense strategies must integrate IT, OT, and AI systems as a single interconnected ecosystem.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity threats, Maritime infrastructure, Ransomware attacks, SCADA vulnerabilities, Integrated defense systems",

    "content": "Amid the clatter of cranes and the hum of container traffic, a port administrator opened what appeared to be a routine email from a long-standing logistics partner. The branding was flawless, with an urgent yet professional tone: update shipping details via the attached file. Minutes after clicking, the port’s cargo tracking system faltered. Containers stalled. Monitors blinked to black. As engineers raced to contain the disruption, a second breach was already unfolding. A security officer received a call from someone claiming to be from IT support – calm, precise, familiar. The officer handed over login credentials without suspicion. Now, inside both backend systems and frontline terminals, the attackers moved swiftly. Berth schedules were altered. Fuel data tampered with. Communications rerouted. It wasn’t until a vessel was directed to an occupied berth that the deception became undeniable. This wasn’t a case of high-tech exploitation – it was a textbook example of low-tech deception executed flawlessly. 01 02 How ransomware is threatening the arteries of global trade The click that cracked the port: A phishing and social engineering cautionary tale 17 On a quiet Monday morning, the port’s automated crane system froze mid-operation. Containers hung suspended like ornaments above the quay. Simultaneously, the surveillance feeds flickered, then vanished. Control rooms went dark. At first, staff suspected a routine software glitch. Within minutes, it became clear: this was no accident. A cyberattack had infiltrated the port’s Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. The entry point? A remote access tool was left active by a third-party vendor. The attackers exploited outdated SCADA software still running on systems from the early 2000s – software with known vulnerabilities and no encryption. Though physical safety systems kicked in to prevent damage, the interruption caused cascading delays. Incoming vessels were redirected. Outbound shipments were halted. Millions in cargo sat idle. The attackers, never identified, vanished as silently as they arrived. They left behind no ransom note, only chaos and a costly aftermath. Modern ports may boast smart technology, but intelligence without security is a vulnerability waiting to be exploited. Every crane, gate, and fuel line connected to a network must be treated not just as machinery but as a potential attack surface. The screens in the port’s control tower went dark at 4:17 a.m. For a moment, the staff assumed a local outage.\n\n---\n## Summary\nA port experienced a severe cyberattack due to a phishing email and social engineering tactics, leading to disruptions in cargo tracking and berth scheduling. The attack exploited outdated SCADA software and a remote access tool left active by a third-party vendor, causing significant delays and financial losses. Despite the advanced technology at modern ports, the incident highlights the vulnerability of such systems to low-tech deception and inadequate security measures.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The cyberattack began with a phishing email from a supposed logistics partner.\n- Attackers gained access to both backend systems and frontline terminals.\n- Outdated SCADA software from the early 2000s was exploited during the attack.\n- A remote access tool left active by a third-party vendor was the entry point.\n- The attack caused millions in cargo to sit idle and significant operational delays.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity breach, Phishing attack, Industrial control systems, Port operations, SCADA vulnerabilities",

    "content": "But as backup systems failed to engage and communication with vessel tracking dashboards timed out, the reality sank in: the port was under digital siege. A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack had flooded the port’s network with tens of millions of requests per second. The origin was global – botnets harnessed from unsecured IoT devices, including some from the port’s own smart sensors. Everything from surveillance feeds to cargo handling schedules was affected. The port’s cloud tools and APIs buckled under the pressure. Firewalls strained to distinguish legitimate traffic from the deluge. This was not a data breach or ransomware demand – it was digital paralysis. Unlike a targeted malware attack, a DDoS offensive does not need to penetrate. It simply overwhelms. 03 04 Locked at the dock: A SCADA sabotage scenario When the tide stops: A DDoS assault on a Smart Port 18 The port’s new logistics platform promised smoother scheduling, better cargo visibility, and seamless vendor integration. What it delivered, inadvertently, was a backdoor for malware. The malware lay dormant until triggered by a remote signal. Once activated, it quietly harvested login credentials, rerouted cargo data, and manipulated customs records. Within days, containers began disappearing from manifests, being misrouted across terminals, or held indefinitely at the dockside. Meanwhile, finance teams were alarmed to find anomalies in transaction logs – unauthorised transfers, ghost invoices, and internal emails suggesting insider fraud. But that was only the beginning. IoT devices – smart cameras, RFID readers, automated cranes – had also been infected. Some now transmitted encrypted data to unknown servers. Others were quietly repurposed into nodes of a global botnet. Many smart ports still rely on legacy infrastructure patched with modern software – an architectural mismatch ripe for exploitation. In 2011, traffickers in Antwerp didn’t storm the port – they logged in. A drug cartel, working with hackers, infiltrated the port’s IT systems, gaining quiet control of terminal operations. It began with malware-laced emails sent to shipping firms and port staff, harvesting credentials and slipping past defences. Over months, traffickers tracked containers in real time, intercepting those stuffed with cocaine before customs could. The breach was more than digital. Insiders – bribed or complicit – helped maintain access and evade suspicion. CCTV feeds were manipulated. Seals on containers appeared untouched. The operation blurred the lines between cyber intrusion and traditional smuggling.\n\n---\n## Summary\nA port experienced a severe Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack that overwhelmed its network, affecting surveillance and cargo handling systems. Additionally, malware exploited the port's logistics platform, leading to data manipulation and potential insider fraud. Historical incidents, such as the Antwerp drug cartel case, highlight the vulnerabilities in port cybersecurity, where insiders and hackers collaborate to bypass security measures.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The port's network was hit by a DDoS attack using botnets from unsecured IoT devices.\n- Malware in the logistics platform harvested credentials and manipulated cargo data.\n- IoT devices were repurposed into nodes of a global botnet.\n- In Antwerp, a drug cartel used cyber intrusion to control terminal operations.\n- Legacy infrastructure in smart ports is vulnerable to cyber exploitation.\n\n## Topics\nDDoS attack, Port cybersecurity, IoT vulnerabilities, Malware exploitation, Insider threats",

    "content": "Only after containers began vanishing with unnerving precision did authorities uncover the breach. For ports – where digital control meets physical flow – it was a wake-up call. Cybersecurity wasn’t just about systems but people: the exploited trust of staff, the ease of unauthorised access, and the quiet power of knowing exactly where a shipment will land. 05 06 The Trojan in the update: Malware and supply chain attacks in ports The enemy within: Insider threats and unauthorised access in ports 19 The smart sensor monitoring refrigerated containers had one job – keeping cargo cool. What it also did, unintentionally, was act as a backdoor for hackers probing the port’s digital infrastructure. Its default login – admin/admin – had never been changed. Smart ports rely on a dense web of IoT devices, most of which are mass-produced with minimal cybersecurity, seldom receive patches, are often deployed without encryption, and, unlike corporate laptops, many IoT devices cannot be easily updated or monitored. In many cases, IoT devices broadcast sensitive data in plain text, a gift to anyone listening. When compromised, IoT devices do not just fail – they can turn hostile. Hackers can hijack security cameras to spy on port operations, disable alarms, or manipulate access gates. Cargo manifests, financial records, shipping schedules, personnel files – the modern port is as much a repository of data as a hub of goods. And that data is increasingly under siege. Ports now face a wave of digital espionage: a slow, stealthy siphoning of trade secrets and logistical intelligence. In some cases, ports have unknowingly leaked data for months before detection. Cybercriminals are no longer content to disrupt – they want to surveil, map, and monetise the data that underpins global commerce. Stolen shipping routes can aid piracy; leaked customs records enable smuggling; and detailed cargo data provides a roadmap for theft. At a busy passenger ferry terminal, disruption rarely starts with alarms. It begins with data that can’t be trusted. A manipulated maintenance log quietly marks a boarding gate as operational. Days later, the gate jams during peak boarding, halting departures. Elsewhere, the port’s AI misroutes ferries and reassigns crews based on falsified schedules. As ports adopt AI to coordinate traffic, conduct surveillance, manage logistics and passengers, they expose new digital weak points. Attackers can fool cameras, corrupt algorithms, or manipulate training data from within.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document highlights the growing cybersecurity threats faced by ports, emphasizing the vulnerabilities introduced by IoT devices and insider threats. Ports, which are crucial nodes in global commerce, are increasingly targeted for digital espionage, with attackers exploiting weak security measures to access sensitive data and disrupt operations. The integration of AI and IoT in port operations has introduced new risks, making cybersecurity a critical concern for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of maritime logistics.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Ports are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to weak IoT device security, such as unchanged default logins.\n- Insider threats and unauthorized access are significant risks in port cybersecurity.\n- Ports face digital espionage, with attackers targeting trade secrets and logistical intelligence.\n- Compromised IoT devices can be used to hijack security cameras and manipulate port operations.\n- AI adoption in ports introduces new vulnerabilities, such as manipulated algorithms and corrupted data.\n\n## Topics\nPort cybersecurity, IoT vulnerabilities, Insider threats, Digital espionage, AI risks",

The traditional approach of building a strong perimeter is no longer sufficient when the perimeter itself has dissolved. True resilience requires moving from a reactive, compliance-driven posture to a proactive, integrated strategy built on the assumption of a breach. This section outlines a three-pillar framework for achieving this resilience, combining modern security architectures, defensible supply chain practices, and a deeply embedded culture of active defence. This is not a checklist of tools, but a strategic blueprint for port leadership. For decades, network security was modelled on a medieval castle: build a strong wall (perimeter firewall), a deep moat (DMZ), and control the drawbridge (access points). Anything inside the wall was trusted, and anything outside was not. In the hyper- connected port ecosystem, with its reliance on cloud services, remote vendor access, mobile devices, and interconnected IT/OT systems, this model is dangerously obsolete. The perimeter is no longer a clear line; it is a porous, ever-changing boundary. The modern paradigm is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). As defined by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Zero Trust is a set of principles that “move defenses from static, network- based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources”. Its core tenet is simple but profound: “never trust, always verify”. This means no user, device, or application is granted implicit trust based on its location (e.g., being on the corporate network). Instead, every single request to access a resource must be individually authenticated and authorised, every time. This shift from a location-centric to an identity-centric security model is the philosophical foundation of a resilient architecture. The following table illustrates the practical differences between these two approaches. The shift in mindset: From perimeter defence to assumed breach Beyond the seawall: A strategic framework for maritime cyber resilience 21 Security principle Traditional (perimeter) approach Modern (Zero Trust) approach Network access “Trust but verify.” Access is granted based on network location (inside vs. outside).\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the evolving cybersecurity challenges in the maritime industry, emphasizing the inadequacy of traditional perimeter-based security models. It advocates for a shift to a Zero Trust Architecture, which focuses on verifying every access attempt rather than relying on network location. This approach is part of a broader strategy to enhance resilience against modern threats, including IoT vulnerabilities and AI manipulation.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Traditional perimeter-based security models are inadequate for modern maritime threats.\n- Zero Trust Architecture focuses on verifying every access attempt, regardless of network location.\n- The document outlines a three-pillar framework for achieving cybersecurity resilience in ports.\n- Modern maritime threats include IoT device vulnerabilities and AI manipulation.\n- The shift from perimeter defense to Zero Trust is crucial for protecting interconnected IT/OT systems.\n\n## Topics\nMaritime cybersecurity, Zero Trust Architecture, IoT vulnerabilities, AI manipulation, Security strategy",

    "content": "“Never trust, always verify.” Access is granted based on authenticated identity, regardless of location. Remote access Broad network access is granted via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Granular, application-specific access is granted on a per-session basis via Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Threat detection Primarily relies on signature-based tools at the network edge to block known threats. Employs continuous monitoring and behavioural analytics across the entire network to detect anomalous activity. Blast radius A single breach can lead to widespread lateral movement across a flat network. The impact of a breach is contained within small, isolated segments (micro-segmentation). User identity Primarily relies on passwords, which are easily stolen or compromised. Relies on strong, verifiable identity using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and robust Identity and Access Management (IAM). Table 1: Modern resilience vs. traditional security 21 22 Pillar 1: Architecting for resilience – Securing the converged IT/OT environment A resilient port architecture cannot be improvised; it must be deliberately designed to contain threats and protect critical functions. This requires integrating proven industrial and security frameworks into a single, cohesive strategy: the Purdue Model for logical structure, the IEC 62443 standard for risk-based controls, and Zero Trust principles for enforcement. The Purdue model as the blueprint: The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA), or Purdue model, provides the foundational blueprint for logically organising and separating industrial networks. It defines a hierarchy of levels, from the physical process devices (Level 0) and basic controls (Level 1) at the bottom, through supervisory control (Level 2) and site-wide operations management (Level 3), up to the enterprise business systems (Level 4) and corporate network (Level 5) at the top. The most critical element for cybersecurity is the establishment of a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), often referred to as Level 3.5, which acts as a strictly controlled buffer between the OT environment (Levels 0-3) and the IT environment (Levels 4-5). This structure provides the map for implementing effective network segmentation. IEC 62443 for OT security controls: While the Purdue model provides the map, the IEC 62443 series of standards provides the rules for securing it.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses modern cybersecurity strategies, emphasizing the importance of a Zero Trust model and the use of multi-factor authentication to enhance security. It highlights the need for a resilient architecture in maritime environments, integrating frameworks like the Purdue Model and IEC 62443 standards to ensure comprehensive protection. The focus is on segmenting networks to contain breaches and employing continuous monitoring to detect threats.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) provides granular, application-specific access on a per-session basis.\n- The Purdue Model organizes industrial networks into hierarchical levels to enhance security.\n- IEC 62443 standards offer rules for securing operational technology (OT) environments.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used to strengthen user identity verification.\n- A Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) acts as a buffer between OT and IT environments in network architecture.\n\n## Topics\nZero Trust Security, Network Segmentation, Purdue Model, Cybersecurity Standards, Identity Management",

    "content": "This international standard for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security operationalises the Purdue concept by defining: • Zones and conduits: A zone is a logical grouping of assets with common security requirements (e.g., all crane control systems). A conduit is the managed communication channel between zones. This allows for the enforcement of security policies at every boundary. • Security levels (SLs): IEC 62443 introduces a risk-based approach to applying controls. It defines four security levels (SL1 to SL4) that correspond to the sophistication of the threat actor, from accidental misuse (SL1) to a nation- state adversary with extensive resources (SL4). This allows organisations to apply proportionate, measurable, and verifiable security controls to each zone based on its criticality and the threats it faces, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Pillar 1 Architecting for resilience – Securing the converged IT/OT environment 22 23 Zero Trust as the enforcement layer: Zero Trust principles provide the dynamic enforcement mechanism for this architecture. It is the “always verify” engine that governs every connection request attempting to cross a zone boundary. Key ZTA applications in this context include: • Micro-segmentation: Using next-generation firewalls and access control lists to enforce the zones and conduits defined by the Purdue/IEC 62443 model, preventing unauthorised lateral movement between systems. A breach of a less critical system, like an environmental sensor, is thus prevented from escalating to an attack on a safety-critical controller. • Strong identity and access management (IAM): Implementing a robust IAM program is central to ZTA. This includes enforcing the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users and services have the absolute minimum permissions required. For all administrators, engineers, and third-party vendors, access must be brokered through a privileged access management (PAM) solution that mandates phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), grants time-bound access, and logs all session activity. • Continuous OT network monitoring: Since security agents cannot be installed on most legacy OT devices, resilience depends on monitoring network traffic for signs of compromise. Specialised network detection and response (NDR) tools, capable of understanding industrial protocols, combined with security information and event management (SIEM) and user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) platforms, are used to baseline normal activity and automatically detect anomalies indicative of a threat.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe international standard for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security operationalizes the Purdue concept by defining zones and conduits, and applying security levels based on threat sophistication. Zero Trust principles are employed to enforce security through micro-segmentation, strong identity and access management, and continuous network monitoring. This approach allows for tailored security measures that protect critical systems from various threat actors.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The Purdue concept involves defining zones and conduits for IACS security.\n- IEC 62443 uses a risk-based approach with four security levels (SL1 to SL4).\n- Zero Trust principles enforce security through micro-segmentation and IAM.\n- Privileged access management includes phishing-resistant MFA and session logging.\n- Continuous OT network monitoring is essential due to legacy device limitations.\n\n## Topics\nIndustrial Automation Security, Zero Trust Architecture, Identity and Access Management, Network Monitoring, Security Levels",

    "content": "Together, these three frameworks form a powerful, integrated “Purdue-IEC-ZTA” stack. The Purdue model provides the logical architecture. IEC 62443 defines the risk-based security requirements and controls for that architecture. Zero Trust provides the dynamic, identity-centric enforcement philosophy that governs all activity within it. This unified strategy provides a clear, actionable, and defensible roadmap for securing the entire converged IT/OT environment. 23 24 Pillar 2: Building a defensible supply chain – Managing third- party and technology risk A port’s security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the modern ecosystem, that weak link is often a third-party supplier or a piece of insecure technology. The supply chain has become a primary attack vector, with the 2024 Verizon DBIR noting a significant increase in breaches involving a third party. Furthermore, the reliance on foreign-manufactured port equipment, such as cranes and scanners, introduces geopolitical risks and concerns about embedded vulnerabilities. A defensible supply chain strategy must address risk across vendors, hardware, and software. Rigorous vendor risk management: The process of vetting third-party suppliers must evolve beyond simple questionnaires. Ports should contractually mandate that all vendors with network access provide independently audited proof of their security posture, such as a recent SOC 2 Type II report or ISO/IEC 27001 certification. Contracts must include legally binding security clauses that grant the port a “Right to Audit” the vendor’s security, and which define strict service level agreements (SLAs) for incident notification, for example, requiring notification of a critical incident within two hours. Secure technology procurement and lifecycle management: Security must be a primary consideration in all technology procurement decisions. • Hardware: Equipment such as IoT devices, sensors, and PLCs should only be sourced from manufacturers who adhere to a transparent secure development lifecycle (SDL). A critical and non-negotiable step in the commissioning process must be to immediately change all default credentials, replacing them with unique, complex passwords managed in a secure vault. • Software: Ports must demand a complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from all software vendors. This inventory of all components and libraries is essential for tracking dependencies and responding quickly when a new vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library. Furthermore, the cryptographic integrity of all new software, patches, and firmware updates must be validated before deployment by verifying digital signatures and checking file hashes against known-good values.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for maritime environments, integrating the Purdue model, IEC 62443 standards, and Zero Trust principles to secure IT/OT systems. It emphasizes the importance of a defensible supply chain, highlighting the need for rigorous vendor risk management and secure technology procurement. The strategy includes specific measures such as requiring security certifications from vendors and ensuring the cryptographic integrity of software updates.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The Purdue-IEC-ZTA stack combines the Purdue model, IEC 62443, and Zero Trust for IT/OT security.\n- The 2024 Verizon DBIR reports a rise in breaches involving third-party suppliers.\n- Ports should require vendors to provide SOC 2 Type II reports or ISO/IEC 27001 certification.\n- Contracts with vendors must include a 'Right to Audit' and strict incident notification SLAs.\n- Secure technology procurement involves changing default credentials and validating software integrity.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity frameworks, Supply chain security, Vendor risk management, Technology procurement, Maritime IT/OT security",

    "content": "Pillar 2 Building a defensible supply chain – Managing third-party and technology risk 24 25 This proactive approach to supply chain security is now being codified by new industry regulations. The IACS Unified Requirements UR E26 and E27, which become mandatory for new ships contracted for construction after July 1, 2024, represent a fundamental shift in accountability. UR E27 focuses on component-level security, requiring original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to build specific security capabilities into their computer-based systems from the ground up. UR E26 addresses the vessel as a whole, requiring the shipbuilder and, later, the owner to maintain a complete asset inventory, document network architecture, and implement a cyber risk management program aligned with the six functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Governance, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). These IACS requirements act as a powerful forcing function for securing the maritime supply chain. They create a clear chain of accountability that runs from the individual component manufacturer, through the systems integrator and shipbuilder, to the vessel owner. For a port operator, this is a significant development. It means that, over time, vessels arriving at their berths will possess a baseline, verifiable level of cyber resilience, reducing the overall risk to the entire port ecosystem. 25 26 Pillar 3 Fostering a culture of active defence – People, process, and preparedness Even the most advanced technology and resilient architecture will fail if not supported by robust processes and a security-conscious culture. The human element is consistently identified as the weakest link, but with the right approach, it can be transformed into the strongest line of defence. This pillar focuses on embedding security into the organisation’s DNA, from the boardroom to the quayside. Executive governance and security culture: Effective cybersecurity starts at the top. It must be treated as a board-level issue, integrated into the organisation’s overall safety culture, not siloed within the IT department. This requires senior management to actively oversee the cybersecurity program, establish clear roles and responsibilities for both IT and OT security, and ensure that a culture of risk awareness is promoted at all levels of the organisation. Advanced security awareness training: To build a resilient “human firewall,” training must evolve beyond annual, check-the-box compliance exercises. A modern program should be: Continuous: Delivered in short, regular modules (microlearning) to keep security top-of-mind.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of building a defensible supply chain and fostering a culture of active defense in maritime cybersecurity. New IACS regulations, UR E26 and E27, mandate enhanced cybersecurity measures for new ships, focusing on both component-level and vessel-wide security.

Realistic: Employing sophisticated phishing simulations that mimic real-world attacks to test and improve vigilance. Role-based: Tailoring content to the specific threats faced by different departments (e.g., finance, operations, HR). Empowering: Educating staff on how to recognise the signs of a potential insider threat and providing clear, confidential, and no-fault channels for reporting suspicious activity. OT-specific incident response (IR): A generic IT incident response plan is inadequate and potentially dangerous in OT environments, where mishandled responses could trigger physical accidents. The IR plan must be tailored to industrial control systems’ unique challenges, prioritising operational safety. This demands detailed playbooks for OT-specific scenarios, such as SCADA compromises, ransomware on Terminal Operating Systems, or safety- instrumented system failures. Plans require regular testing through tabletop exercises involving IT, OT, operations, and executive participants for coordinated responses, plus simulated real-time drills that evaluate those responses, protected systems, and coordination tools. The imperative for robust governance, training, and response is now being driven by powerful new regulations, most notably the EU’s NIS2 Directive. Effective as of October 2024, NIS2 dramatically raises the stakes for critical infrastructure operators, including ports. It mandates a comprehensive set of risk management measures, including supply chain security, incident handling, and robust access control. It also imposes strict reporting timelines, requiring an initial notification of a significant incident within 24 hours. Most critically, NIS2 introduces direct liability for senior management, who can be held personally accountable for non-compliance.

Implement specific cybersecurity risk management measures, secure supply chains, establish incident response plans, and adhere to strict 24-hour incident reporting. Direct enforcement by national authorities. Fines up to €10 million or 2 % of global turnover. Personal liability for senior management. Table 2: The maritime regulatory landscape at a glance The penalties are severe, with fines for “essential entities” reaching up to €10 million or 2 % of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. The following table provides a high-level comparison of the key regulations shaping the maritime cyber landscape. These regulations, particularly NIS2, provide a powerful financial and legal incentive for boards and C-suites to make cybersecurity a strategic priority, transforming it from a technical issue into a fundamental component of corporate governance. 27 28 Making the business case: From cost centre to competitive advantage For too long, cybersecurity has been viewed as a necessary but burdensome cost centre. This perspective is no longer tenable. In the modern maritime environment, robust cybersecurity is a direct enabler of business objectives. The business case for investment rests on three pillars: risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation. The return on investment (ROI) for security is often framed by the costs of inaction. As detailed earlier, the financial impact of a single incident, from downtime costs exceeding €200,000 per hour to multi-million-dollar ransom payments and regulatory fines, can be catastrophic. Proactive investment in measures like network segmentation and incident response planning has been shown to significantly reduce the impact of a breach, minimising operational disruption and containing financial damage. A port that can demonstrate a mature, resilient security posture is fundamentally a more reliable partner in a fragile global supply chain. This reliability becomes a powerful competitive differentiator, attracting customers who are increasingly aware of the systemic risks posed by cyber threats. Furthermore, the new wave of regulations like IACS UR E26/E27 and the NIS2 directive provides a clear catalyst for modernisation. The looming deadlines and severe penalties for non-compliance create an undeniable impetus for budget allocation and strategic planning. Forward-thinking organisations will use these regulations not as a ceiling to aim for, but as a floor upon which to build a truly resilient security program that goes beyond mere compliance to become a source of operational strength.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe EU NIS2 directive mandates cybersecurity measures for essential and important entities in the EU transport sector, including ports and water transport companies, with strict incident reporting and potential fines for non-compliance. This directive, along with other regulations, encourages organizations to prioritize cybersecurity as a strategic business component rather than a mere technical issue. Investing in cybersecurity not only ensures regulatory compliance but also serves as a competitive advantage by enhancing reliability and resilience in the global supply chain.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The EU NIS2 directive requires 24-hour incident reporting for transport sector entities.\n- Fines for non-compliance can reach up to €10 million or 2% of global turnover.\n- Senior management may face personal liability under the NIS2 directive.\n- Cybersecurity investment is framed as a competitive advantage and risk mitigation strategy.\n- Regulations like IACS UR E26/E27 and NIS2 drive modernization and strategic planning.\n\n## Topics\nEU NIS2 directive, Cybersecurity compliance, Maritime transport sector, Regulatory penalties, Strategic business advantage",

    "content": "Charting the course: An action plan for port leadership Understanding the threats and the strategic framework for resilience is essential, but it is not enough. Leadership requires a clear, actionable plan to translate strategy into reality. This concluding section outlines the business case for investment in cybersecurity and provides a practical, phased roadmap for implementation. It reframes cybersecurity not as a cost to be minimised, but as a critical investment in operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and long-term competitive advantage. 29 Phase 1: Foundational visibility and governance Actions: • Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment: Engage experts to perform a thorough assessment of the converged IT and OT environments to identify critical assets, vulnerabilities, and realistic threat scenarios. • Create a complete asset inventory: Develop and maintain a detailed inventory of all connected IT, OT, and IoT assets, including their software versions and network connections. This is a foundational requirement of IACS UR E26. • Establish cross-functional governance: Form a cybersecurity steering committee with representation from IT, OT, operations, legal, and executive leadership to ensure strategic alignment and oversight. • Develop and test an OT-specific incident response plan: Create an initial IR plan tailored to OT environments, prioritising safety and operational continuity. Test this plan with a tabletop exercise involving all key stakeholders. • Goal: To move from a state of unknown risk to one of understood risk, with clear governance and a baseline plan for crisis management. A phased roadmap to resilience The journey to a mature, Zero Trust-based security posture is a marathon, not a sprint. A phased approach allows organisations to make meaningful progress, achieve early wins, and build momentum over time. The following three-phase roadmap provides a high-level guide for port leadership. The first phase is about understanding the terrain and establishing control. You cannot protect what you cannot see. 29 30 Phase 2: Architectural hardening Phase 3: Advanced resilience and optimisation Actions: • Implement foundational network segmentation: Architect the network according to the Purdue model, establishing a DMZ to create a hard separation between the IT and OT environments. • Deploy OT-aware network monitoring: Implement passive network detection and response (NDR) tools within the OT environment to gain visibility into traffic patterns and detect anomalous behaviour. • Begin implementing robust IAM/PAM: Roll out a privileged access management (PAM) solution for all administrative and remote access to critical OT systems, enforcing multi- factor authentication (MFA).\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines a strategic action plan for port leadership to enhance cybersecurity resilience, emphasizing the importance of viewing cybersecurity as a critical investment rather than a cost. It proposes a phased roadmap, starting with foundational visibility and governance, followed by architectural hardening, and culminating in advanced resilience and optimization. The plan includes conducting risk assessments, creating asset inventories, and establishing cross-functional governance to ensure strategic alignment and oversight.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The action plan emphasizes cybersecurity as a critical investment for operational resilience and competitive advantage.\n- Phase 1 involves conducting a comprehensive risk assessment and creating a detailed asset inventory.\n- Establishing cross-functional governance is crucial for strategic alignment and oversight in cybersecurity efforts.\n- The roadmap includes implementing network segmentation and deploying OT-aware network monitoring.\n- Advanced phases focus on robust identity and access management and optimizing security measures.\n\n## Topics\nCybersecurity investment, Port leadership strategy, Risk assessment, Network segmentation, Identity management",

Actions: • Mature towards a full Zero Trust architecture: Implement micro-segmentation within the OT environment, creating smaller security zones around critical processes and assets to further contain threats. • Integrate advanced threat detection: Enhance monitoring capabilities by integrating SIEM and UEBA platforms to correlate alerts from across the IT/OT landscape and use AI-based analytics to detect sophisticated threats. • Formalise and automate supply chain security: Implement automated tools for validating software integrity (SBOM analysis, cryptographic verification) and formalise the vendor risk management program with contractual and audit requirements. • Goal: To achieve a state of active, adaptive defence and continuous improvement that can detect and respond to threats in real-time, underpinned by a secure architecture and a resilient supply chain. With a clear understanding of the environment, the next phase focuses on building foundational architectural controls to contain threats. The final phase involves maturing the security program toward a dynamic, proactive state of defence. 30 31 As ports continue to innovate, the security paradigm must evolve in lockstep. The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence for logistics optimisation and the deployment of autonomous trucks and drones introduce a new and complex attack surface. Securing these systems cannot be an ad hoc; it must be integral to their design and deployment. The focus must be on securing the entire machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline—the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying AI models. This requires a new set of security controls, including: • Data provenance and integrity: Ensuring that the data used to train AI models comes from trusted sources and has not been tampered with or “poisoned” by an adversary. • Model integrity verification: Using cryptographic techniques to ensure that the AI model deployed in production is the same one that was tested and validated, preventing unauthorised modification. • Secure runtimes: Deploying models in hardened, isolated environments (e.g., secure containers) to protect them from compromise during operation. By addressing these emerging challenges proactively, port operators can ensure that their investments in next-generation technology deliver on their promise of efficiency without introducing unacceptable levels of risk.

    "content": "Embedding Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat resilience 3 Cybercrime is predicted to cost the world about €10.5 trillion in 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. 4 Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. There is much industry discussion regarding the transition from reactive to proactive cybersecurity, but true cyber resilience demands both. We must accept the inevitable: our organisations will be attacked. While detection and prevention remain crucial, the hallmark of a resilient organisation lies in its ability to respond to and recover from cyber incidents effectively. This mindset means putting measures in place that limit damage and keep critical functions running— ensuring your business stays operational even against the most sophisticated attacks. This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience— embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer- centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCybercrime is projected to cost the world €10.5 trillion by 2025, making it the third-largest economy if measured as a country. Organizations must shift from a focus on prevention to embracing cyber resilience, which involves accepting that attacks are inevitable and preparing to respond and recover effectively. This approach requires integrating security into all aspects of operations and fostering a culture where cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Cybercrime is expected to cost €10.5 trillion globally by 2025.\n- If cybercrime were a country, it would be the third-largest economy after the U.S. and China.\n- Organizations are encouraged to adopt a 'when, not if' mindset towards cyber attacks.\n- Cyber resilience involves integrating security measures into all business operations.\n- A resilient culture requires all employees to understand and respond to cyber risks.\n\n## Topics\nCybercrime Costs, Cyber Resilience, Digital Transformation, Security Integration, Organizational Culture",

Robust organisations have pivoted from the misguided notion of outright prevention to a focus on resilience—the “when, not if” mentality. Those same organisations understand that a high wall is never enough; a plan must be developed, implemented, and tested for when an organisation is breached, but a real plan, not just a token one. On May 12, 2017, the world witnessed one of the gravest ransomware attacks in history—WannaCry. This self-propagating ransomware worm exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows called EternalBlue, a leaked exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The attack spread rapidly across the globe, encrypting files on infected systems and demanding $300 in Bitcoin for decryption, doubling if payment wasn’t made within three days. Within hours, WannaCry had infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, telecom companies, and government agencies were among the hardest hit. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) suffered massive disruptions with up to 70,000 affected devices, from MRI scanners to operating theatres, forcing hospitals to cancel surgeries and turn away patients. FedEx, Boeing, Deutsche Bahn, and many automotive manufacturers were also affected. Organisations faced severe consequences: financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. The global cost is estimated at between €4 and €8 billion. 4 Despite its scale, WannaCry could have been prevented.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document highlights the increasing threat of cyberattacks, with 90% of organizations expecting a rise in such incidents in 2024.

    "content": "Microsoft had released a security patch (MS17-010) two months prior, but many organisations, for one reason or another, had yet to update their systems. Beyond patching, a comprehensive resilience approach—including initiatives such as proper governance, network segmentation, endpoint detection, backup strategies, incident response planning, and employee awareness—would have significantly reduced the impact. A major turning point came when a security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, accidentally discovered a ‘kill switch,’ a hardcoded domain that, when registered, stopped WannaCry’s spread. While this fortunate discovery helped contain the initial outbreak, variants without this kill switch later emerged. This evolution demonstrates that reliance on reactive, one-time solutions is inherently risky. Had organisations implemented a culture of resilience rather than depending on emergency interventions, they would have been better positioned against both the original attack and its variants. The WannaCry saga ultimately proves that cyber resilience requires systematic, proactive approaches rather than hoping for last-minute rescues. 7 Token efforts vs. business benefit Despite the clear risk, many, if not most, companies are not acting with sincerity in the face of growing cyberattacks. Token efforts are the norm. There are two key indicators of such superficial approaches: First, companies that lack a senior business leader who champions cybersecurity at the executive level. While formal structures may vary, the absence of C-suite advocacy and accountability—whether through a dedicated information security board or direct representation in leadership meetings— signals that security isn’t truly embedded in business strategy. The second indicator is inadequate risk management: either cyber risks are absent from operational risk registers entirely, or they exist merely as generic entries without proper classification, regular updates, or specific mitigation plans. Simply having “cyber” listed on a risk register without corresponding awareness campaigns and training for all employees reveals a disconnect between acknowledged risks and meaningful action. To some extent, this is understandable; the market demands we “move fast,” forcing us into a constant race to deliver products and services quickly. This urgency often relegates security to secondary importance due to the misconception that it impedes speed and agility. When security isn’t integrated from the beginning as part of the design process, it becomes a bottleneck, requiring expensive rework and retroactive changes. What’s ironic is that secure-by-design products actually serve as powerful market differentiators in today’s landscape, where consumers increasingly value the protection of their data and privacy. Take AI, for example.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe WannaCry ransomware attack highlighted the importance of proactive cyber resilience strategies, as many organizations failed to update their systems despite available patches. A security researcher accidentally discovered a 'kill switch' that temporarily halted the attack, but variants without this switch later emerged, underscoring the need for systematic resilience rather than reliance on reactive measures. Companies often make token efforts towards cybersecurity, lacking executive advocacy and proper risk management, which can hinder their ability to effectively respond to cyber threats.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Microsoft released a security patch (MS17-010) two months before the WannaCry attack.\n- Marcus Hutchins discovered a 'kill switch' that stopped WannaCry's initial spread.\n- Variants of WannaCry without the 'kill switch' later emerged, continuing the threat.\n- Many companies lack a senior leader championing cybersecurity at the executive level.\n- Secure-by-design products can differentiate companies in a market valuing data protection.\n\n## Topics\nCyber Resilience, WannaCry Ransomware, Security Patches, Risk Management, Executive Advocacy",

    "content": "If a proven-secure AI product existed, that would be a market differentiator. Imagine a self-driving car with engineered resilience in data protection and also in servicing the vehicle and in customer relationships. But this does not exist. The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Business benefit defined Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Take, for example, the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act. While the CRA is not applicable in the United States or the United Kingdom, these countries have, or soon will, their own fundamentally similar 1 legislation—a mandated cyber resilience requirement to do business within their territory. So, one quantifiable return on cyber resilience is the very ability to operate in those markets. A second quantifiable benefit is reduced spending on incident response and recovery. For example, in 2024, the average cost of a data breach was €4.66 million, and the average cost of a malicious insider attack was €4.76 million, according to IBM’s Cost of Data Breach Report.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of embedding resilience in AI products and businesses, emphasizing that all businesses are now tech businesses due to internet connectivity.

So, a security program as a resilience measure is an order of magnitude cheaper than trying to rebuild the company post-compromise. This is true both financially and reputationally, the latter more often reflected in customer behaviour or share price. Take, for example, the shipping giant Maersk—the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 infected almost 50,000 of their systems across 600 sites in 130 countries. The losses grew to nearly €300 million, affecting close to 90,000 workers, port infrastructure, customers, and end-users. This single attack caused a 20% drop in business volume. Within the public sector, cyber incidents can also cause serious downtime, disrupting essential services and threatening public safety and national security. Finally, it is worth noting that companies that respond well to a cyberattack—meaning they have resilience measures in place and react with speed and transparency— typically experience stronger recoveries, often seeing their share prices rise above pre- incident levels. The Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2023 emphasizes this, terming companies that align security with business objectives “cyber transformers.” These companies reported 26% lower costs from breaches than other respondent organisations and were 18% more likely to increase revenue growth. Effective incident response and transparent communication significantly impact reputation—particularly crucial for public sector organisations where reputation directly builds citizen trust, an asset more valuable than gold. Trust serves as democracy’s foundation, providing governments with the legitimacy needed for effective operation. Citizens willingly share their data in trusted relationships, enabling enhanced digital services. However, this creates an obligation for organisations to safeguard the data entrusted to them. At Nortal, we define trust through the principles of reliability, fairness, and transparency, with successful execution being the critical factor that brings these elements together.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of cybersecurity resilience for organizations, highlighting that prioritizing cyber investments can significantly reduce breach costs.

    "content": "1 Average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million Average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 was €4.76 million 11 So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: 1 https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/ • How does the organisation make money or deliver value? • What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/ or services provided? • What is the threat to each? • Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? • Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The cost of resilience The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. A company that does not manufacture nuclear missiles may not need state-of-the-art security; for a local bakery, state-of-the-art would arguably be overkill. High levels of resilience are expensive and might be unnecessary for your business context. But if you operate a real-time business, having your services unavailable even for a few seconds or minutes could mean more revenue lost than a solution would cost. The human element represents a significant cost factor in cyber resilience planning. According to Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report 1, 68% of breaches involve a non-malicious human element, making people the most expensive vulnerability to address. Social engineering attacks succeed when employees click malicious links or divulge sensitive information, often resulting in costly breaches. Failing to invest in human-centred resilience measures represents a substantial financial risk. A comprehensive cyber resilience budget must allocate resources to inform and train employees, conduct regular security exercises to test defences, and develop robust response and recovery protocols. The cost extends beyond internal measures to include communication systems for stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies. This human dimension of cyber resilience is a discipline requiring specific investment but one that typically delivers the highest return in breach prevention and cost avoidance. Most important is to realize there is no “silver bullet.” The fact that millions are spent is no guarantee of security. True cyber resilience means a constant review of investment to keep pace with changing threats and adversaries.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document discusses the importance of aligning cyber resilience programs with business needs, emphasizing that resilience costs are dictated by specific organizational requirements rather than a fixed percentage of turnover.

Thieves are constantly finding new ways of breaking and entering, and the market keeps pace with the development of better locks and alarms. For this reason, cyber resilience should be viewed as a continuous process that must be sized to the needs of the business. 13 03 04 Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organisation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. • Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks • Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities • Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities • Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics • Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents • Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions • Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities • Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity • Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities • Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements • Supply chain security and third-party risk management • Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures • Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats • Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways • Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements Intelligence & adaption 02 01 The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. The traditional defence layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCyber resilience is a continuous process tailored to business needs, integrating incident response with business continuity to ensure operational resilience.

    "content": "Organisations with lower maturity levels should prioritize foundational understanding—identifying problems, mapping threats, and quantifying the business impact of potential downtime or data loss. Meanwhile, more mature organisations can devote greater resources toward implementation and advanced resilience strategies, building upon their existing security framework. 17 Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping begins with a deep exploration of organisational purpose, going beyond surface-level statements to understand the fundamental value an organisation provides to its stakeholders. This understanding forms the basis for identifying critical functions—those essential activities that must be maintained even under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping provide insight into how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing obvious and subtle interdependencies that could affect resilience. This mapping exercise extends to stakeholder relationships, creating a comprehensive understanding of how the organisation interacts with its ecosystem, including its supply chain. This phase is the key element to resilience. Knowing an organisation’s purpose and how it fulfils that purpose allows assumptions to be made and examined. Take an electric vehicle company as an example. One might assume the company earns its revenue from selling vehicles, which may be true. But what if it made its revenue from reselling data to other manufacturers of vehicles? Incorrect assumptions often lead to over-optimisation for the wrong outcome. Historically, this problem has been made worse as cyber was seen as a technical problem, one decoupled from the business context and given to engineers to resolve. Present an engineer with a problem, and it’s possible you’ll receive an exquisite overengineered solution. Mission mapping ensures that the right business problem is addressed so that solutions are scaled and applied where they are actually needed. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines a framework for enhancing organizational resilience, emphasizing the importance of understanding an organization's mission and capabilities. It suggests that organizations with lower maturity should focus on foundational resilience strategies, while more mature organizations can implement advanced strategies. Key phases include mission mapping, capability assessment, and gap analysis to ensure that resilience measures are aligned with business objectives.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Mission mapping involves understanding an organization's fundamental purpose and critical functions.\n- Capability assessment evaluates an organization's adaptive capacity using both quantitative and qualitative measures.\n- Gap analysis identifies areas for improvement by comparing current resilience posture with desired state.\n- Organizations with lower maturity should focus on foundational resilience strategies.\n- Advanced resilience strategies are suitable for more mature organizations with existing security frameworks.\n\n## Topics\nOrganizational resilience, Mission mapping, Capability assessment, Gap analysis, Resilience strategies",

    "content": "This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability. Adopting the “when, not if” mindset ensures that organisations are prepared to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats with minimal disruption. Resilience is not a one-time investment but an ongoing commitment—requiring continuous monitoring, training, and adaptation to remain effective. By embedding cyber resilience into daily operations and long-term planning, organisations can mitigate damage, maintain trust, safeguard business continuity, and save money.

    "content": "Embedding Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat resilience 3 Cybercrime is predicted to cost the world about €10.5 trillion in 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. 4 Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. There is much industry discussion regarding the transition from reactive to proactive cybersecurity, but true cyber resilience demands both. We must accept the inevitable: our organisations will be attacked. While detection and prevention remain crucial, the hallmark of a resilient organisation lies in its ability to respond to and recover from cyber incidents effectively. This mindset means putting measures in place that limit damage and keep critical functions running— ensuring your business stays operational even against the most sophisticated attacks. This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience— embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer- centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCybercrime is rapidly increasing and is predicted to cost the world €10.5 trillion by 2025, making it a significant global economic force. Organizations are encouraged to adopt a 'when, not if' mindset towards cyberattacks, focusing on resilience rather than just prevention. Cyber resilience involves integrating security into all aspects of an organization, requiring a cultural shift where cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across all levels.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Cybercrime is expected to cost €10.5 trillion globally by 2025.\n- If cybercrime were a country, it would be the third-largest economy after the U.S. and China.\n- Cyber resilience requires a shift from prevention to a 'when, not if' approach to cyberattacks.\n- Organizations should embed security into all transformation projects from the start.\n- Cyber resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership, not just technical tools.\n\n## Topics\nCybercrime Costs, Cyber Resilience, Organizational Security, Digital Transformation, Security Culture",

Robust organisations have pivoted from the misguided notion of outright prevention to a focus on resilience—the “when, not if” mentality. Those same organisations understand that a high wall is never enough; a plan must be developed, implemented, and tested for when an organisation is breached, but a real plan, not just a token one. On May 12, 2017, the world witnessed one of the gravest ransomware attacks in history—WannaCry. This self-propagating ransomware worm exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows called EternalBlue, a leaked exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The attack spread rapidly across the globe, encrypting files on infected systems and demanding $300 in Bitcoin for decryption, doubling if payment wasn’t made within three days. Within hours, WannaCry had infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, telecom companies, and government agencies were among the hardest hit. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) suffered massive disruptions with up to 70,000 affected devices, from MRI scanners to operating theatres, forcing hospitals to cancel surgeries and turn away patients. FedEx, Boeing, Deutsche Bahn, and many automotive manufacturers were also affected. Organisations faced severe consequences: financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. The global cost is estimated at between €4 and €8 billion. 4 Despite its scale, WannaCry could have been prevented.\n\n---\n## Summary\nIn 2024, 42% of organizations experienced phishing and social engineering attacks, while 90% anticipate an increase in cyberattacks.

    "content": "Microsoft had released a security patch (MS17-010) two months prior, but many organisations, for one reason or another, had yet to update their systems. Beyond patching, a comprehensive resilience approach—including initiatives such as proper governance, network segmentation, endpoint detection, backup strategies, incident response planning, and employee awareness—would have significantly reduced the impact. A major turning point came when a security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, accidentally discovered a ‘kill switch,’ a hardcoded domain that, when registered, stopped WannaCry’s spread. While this fortunate discovery helped contain the initial outbreak, variants without this kill switch later emerged. This evolution demonstrates that reliance on reactive, one-time solutions is inherently risky. Had organisations implemented a culture of resilience rather than depending on emergency interventions, they would have been better positioned against both the original attack and its variants. The WannaCry saga ultimately proves that cyber resilience requires systematic, proactive approaches rather than hoping for last-minute rescues. 7 Token efforts vs. business benefit Despite the clear risk, many, if not most, companies are not acting with sincerity in the face of growing cyberattacks. Token efforts are the norm. There are two key indicators of such superficial approaches: First, companies that lack a senior business leader who champions cybersecurity at the executive level. While formal structures may vary, the absence of C-suite advocacy and accountability—whether through a dedicated information security board or direct representation in leadership meetings— signals that security isn’t truly embedded in business strategy. The second indicator is inadequate risk management: either cyber risks are absent from operational risk registers entirely, or they exist merely as generic entries without proper classification, regular updates, or specific mitigation plans. Simply having “cyber” listed on a risk register without corresponding awareness campaigns and training for all employees reveals a disconnect between acknowledged risks and meaningful action. To some extent, this is understandable; the market demands we “move fast,” forcing us into a constant race to deliver products and services quickly. This urgency often relegates security to secondary importance due to the misconception that it impedes speed and agility. When security isn’t integrated from the beginning as part of the design process, it becomes a bottleneck, requiring expensive rework and retroactive changes. What’s ironic is that secure-by-design products actually serve as powerful market differentiators in today’s landscape, where consumers increasingly value the protection of their data and privacy. Take AI, for example.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe WannaCry ransomware attack highlighted the importance of proactive cyber resilience strategies over reactive measures. Despite the availability of a security patch, many organizations failed to update their systems, leading to widespread impact until a 'kill switch' was accidentally discovered. The incident underscores the need for comprehensive cybersecurity governance and integration into business strategies to prevent future threats.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Microsoft released a security patch (MS17-010) two months before the WannaCry attack.\n- Marcus Hutchins discovered a 'kill switch' that halted the initial spread of WannaCry.\n- Variants of WannaCry emerged without the 'kill switch,' showing the risk of relying on reactive solutions.\n- Organizations often lack senior business leaders advocating for cybersecurity at the executive level.\n- Cybersecurity is often seen as a bottleneck, despite secure-by-design products being market differentiators.\n\n## Topics\nCyber resilience, WannaCry attack, Security governance, Proactive cybersecurity, Business strategy",

    "content": "If a proven-secure AI product existed, that would be a market differentiator. Imagine a self-driving car with engineered resilience in data protection and also in servicing the vehicle and in customer relationships. But this does not exist. The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Business benefit defined Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Take, for example, the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act. While the CRA is not applicable in the United States or the United Kingdom, these countries have, or soon will, their own fundamentally similar 1 legislation—a mandated cyber resilience requirement to do business within their territory. So, one quantifiable return on cyber resilience is the very ability to operate in those markets. A second quantifiable benefit is reduced spending on incident response and recovery. For example, in 2024, the average cost of a data breach was €4.66 million, and the average cost of a malicious insider attack was €4.76 million, according to IBM’s Cost of Data Breach Report.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCyber resilience is increasingly critical as all businesses are now tech businesses, making data breaches a business issue rather than just a technology problem. Despite its importance, cyber resilience often faces budget cuts due to challenges in demonstrating ROI. However, frameworks can be developed to quantify its value, including compliance with regulations like the EU's Cyber Resilience Act and reduced costs from incident response.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million.\n- The average cost of a malicious insider attack was €4.76 million in 2024.\n- The European Union's Cyber Resilience Act mandates cyber resilience for market operations.\n- Cyber resilience is often seen as a hindrance due to difficulties in demonstrating ROI.\n- All businesses are now considered tech businesses due to universal internet connectivity.\n\n## Topics\nCyber resilience, Data breaches, Business technology, Regulatory compliance, Investment ROI",

So, a security program as a resilience measure is an order of magnitude cheaper than trying to rebuild the company post-compromise. This is true both financially and reputationally, the latter more often reflected in customer behaviour or share price. Take, for example, the shipping giant Maersk—the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 infected almost 50,000 of their systems across 600 sites in 130 countries. The losses grew to nearly €300 million, affecting close to 90,000 workers, port infrastructure, customers, and end-users. This single attack caused a 20% drop in business volume. Within the public sector, cyber incidents can also cause serious downtime, disrupting essential services and threatening public safety and national security. Finally, it is worth noting that companies that respond well to a cyberattack—meaning they have resilience measures in place and react with speed and transparency— typically experience stronger recoveries, often seeing their share prices rise above pre- incident levels. The Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2023 emphasizes this, terming companies that align security with business objectives “cyber transformers.” These companies reported 26% lower costs from breaches than other respondent organisations and were 18% more likely to increase revenue growth. Effective incident response and transparent communication significantly impact reputation—particularly crucial for public sector organisations where reputation directly builds citizen trust, an asset more valuable than gold. Trust serves as democracy’s foundation, providing governments with the legitimacy needed for effective operation. Citizens willingly share their data in trusted relationships, enabling enhanced digital services. However, this creates an obligation for organisations to safeguard the data entrusted to them. At Nortal, we define trust through the principles of reliability, fairness, and transparency, with successful execution being the critical factor that brings these elements together.\n\n---\n## Summary\nInvesting in cyber resilience significantly reduces the financial and reputational costs of cyber breaches, as demonstrated by companies like Maersk and highlighted in Accenture's research.

    "content": "1 Average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million Average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 was €4.76 million 11 So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: 1 https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/ • How does the organisation make money or deliver value? • What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/ or services provided? • What is the threat to each? • Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? • Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The cost of resilience The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. A company that does not manufacture nuclear missiles may not need state-of-the-art security; for a local bakery, state-of-the-art would arguably be overkill. High levels of resilience are expensive and might be unnecessary for your business context. But if you operate a real-time business, having your services unavailable even for a few seconds or minutes could mean more revenue lost than a solution would cost. The human element represents a significant cost factor in cyber resilience planning. According to Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report 1, 68% of breaches involve a non-malicious human element, making people the most expensive vulnerability to address. Social engineering attacks succeed when employees click malicious links or divulge sensitive information, often resulting in costly breaches. Failing to invest in human-centred resilience measures represents a substantial financial risk. A comprehensive cyber resilience budget must allocate resources to inform and train employees, conduct regular security exercises to test defences, and develop robust response and recovery protocols. The cost extends beyond internal measures to include communication systems for stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies. This human dimension of cyber resilience is a discipline requiring specific investment but one that typically delivers the highest return in breach prevention and cost avoidance. Most important is to realize there is no “silver bullet.” The fact that millions are spent is no guarantee of security. True cyber resilience means a constant review of investment to keep pace with changing threats and adversaries.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million, with malicious insider attacks costing slightly more at €4.76 million. Cyber resilience costs are not a fixed percentage of turnover but depend on the specific needs and threats faced by an organization. A significant portion of these costs involves addressing the human element, as 68% of breaches involve non-malicious human actions, highlighting the need for employee training and robust response protocols.\n\n## Key Facts\n- The average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million.\n- Malicious insider attacks in 2024 cost an average of €4.76 million.\n- 68% of data breaches involve a non-malicious human element.\n- Cyber resilience costs depend on organizational needs and threats.\n- Employee training is crucial for effective cyber resilience.\n\n## Topics\nCyber resilience costs, Data breach statistics, Human element in security, Employee training, Security investment",

Thieves are constantly finding new ways of breaking and entering, and the market keeps pace with the development of better locks and alarms. For this reason, cyber resilience should be viewed as a continuous process that must be sized to the needs of the business. 13 03 04 Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organisation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. • Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks • Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities • Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities • Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics • Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents • Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions • Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities • Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity • Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities • Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements • Supply chain security and third-party risk management • Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures • Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats • Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways • Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements Intelligence & adaption 02 01 The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. The traditional defence layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience.\n\n---\n## Summary\nCyber resilience is a continuous process essential for businesses to effectively respond to incidents while maintaining operations. It involves integrating incident response with business continuity planning, assuming incidents are inevitable and focusing on operational resilience.

    "content": "A continuous learning loop that leverages threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defences and responses The intelligence and adaption block ensures that organisations can systematically analyse the value of their current defences and make informed adjustments where necessary. Moreover, the adaption process involves internalizing lessons learned from post-incident reviews and active engagement with external intelligence sources and collaborative industry networks. This ensures that our organisations learn and grow from our own experiences and also from those of other organisations. It also ensures that we remain at the forefront of best practices and can continually refine our policies and processes to meet new challenges head-on. • Deliberate security architectures aligned to organisational goals, objectives, and structures • Resilience by design principles • Supply chain security controls • Security culture and capability development • Access controls, encryption, and network security measures • Endpoint and application security • Regular vulnerability assessments, patch management, and continuous security and business alignment validation • Alignment with the “Protect” function of NIST and the Annex A controls of ISO 27001 • Proactive threat hunting and continuous monitoring • Intelligence-led testing and validation • Analytics, reporting, and feedback mechanisms • Emerging Tech impact assessments • Predictive analytics • Incorporation of lessons learned into strategy, policy, and process updates • Engagement with external intelligence sources and collaboration with industry peers • Review of emerging threats and recommendations regarding strategy, policy, and process • Leadership commitment and clear accountability • Risk management and asset identification (aligns with NIST’s Identify function and ISO’s context and leadership clauses) • Integration of cyber resilience into business continuity planning • Regular review and refinement of policies to address evolving threats • Regulatory and legal compliance, mapping to relevant standards • Organisational value alignment; cyber strategies support business objectives and value generation • Reporting structures and escalation pathways • Investment prioritization • Operational dependency mapping • Operational Impact analysis (BIA) Governance & strategy The building blocks of embedding resilience Protect & secure A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation 15 Embedding resilience To embed the cyber resilience process, we need to embrace erudition, constantly learn from our mistakes, and then adapt and apply those lessons to any given context, not once, not twice, but continuously. Cyber resilience can then be embedded through four distinct phases, constantly monitored as threats and risks evolve. Approaches to embedding cyber resilience will necessarily vary based on organisational maturity.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines a continuous learning loop for cyber resilience, emphasizing threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defenses and responses.

    "content": "Organisations with lower maturity levels should prioritize foundational understanding—identifying problems, mapping threats, and quantifying the business impact of potential downtime or data loss. Meanwhile, more mature organisations can devote greater resources toward implementation and advanced resilience strategies, building upon their existing security framework. 17 Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping begins with a deep exploration of organisational purpose, going beyond surface-level statements to understand the fundamental value an organisation provides to its stakeholders. This understanding forms the basis for identifying critical functions—those essential activities that must be maintained even under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping provide insight into how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing obvious and subtle interdependencies that could affect resilience. This mapping exercise extends to stakeholder relationships, creating a comprehensive understanding of how the organisation interacts with its ecosystem, including its supply chain. This phase is the key element to resilience. Knowing an organisation’s purpose and how it fulfils that purpose allows assumptions to be made and examined. Take an electric vehicle company as an example. One might assume the company earns its revenue from selling vehicles, which may be true. But what if it made its revenue from reselling data to other manufacturers of vehicles? Incorrect assumptions often lead to over-optimisation for the wrong outcome. Historically, this problem has been made worse as cyber was seen as a technical problem, one decoupled from the business context and given to engineers to resolve. Present an engineer with a problem, and it’s possible you’ll receive an exquisite overengineered solution. Mission mapping ensures that the right business problem is addressed so that solutions are scaled and applied where they are actually needed. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers.\n\n---\n## Summary\nThe document outlines a framework for enhancing cyberresilience in organizations, emphasizing the importance of mission mapping, capability assessment, and gap analysis. It highlights the need for organizations to understand their core functions and interdependencies to effectively address resilience challenges. The approach combines both technical and human factors to ensure comprehensive resilience strategies.\n\n## Key Facts\n- Mission mapping involves understanding an organization's fundamental value and critical functions.\n- Capability assessment evaluates an organization's adaptive capacity using both quantitative and qualitative measures.\n- Gap analysis identifies areas for improvement by comparing current and desired resilience postures.\n- Organizations with lower maturity should focus on foundational understanding, while mature ones can implement advanced strategies.\n- Cyberresilience requires integrating business context with technical solutions to avoid overengineering.\n\n## Topics\nCyberresilience strategies, Mission mapping, Capability assessment, Gap analysis, Organizational resilience",

    "content": "This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability. Adopting the “when, not if” mindset ensures that organisations are prepared to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats with minimal disruption. Resilience is not a one-time investment but an ongoing commitment—requiring continuous monitoring, training, and adaptation to remain effective. By embedding cyber resilience into daily operations and long-term planning, organisations can mitigate damage, maintain trust, safeguard business continuity, and save money. In an era where cyber threats are inevitable, true resilience lies in a culture of resilience-by-design thinking.
