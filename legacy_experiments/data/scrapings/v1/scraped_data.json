A culture of growth and meaningful work Leadership Founder's perspective I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO The opportunity to reshape the future is now I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap. I envisioned a society where everything just works. Everything happens in the background seamlessly, so citizens and businesses can focus on what truly matters—what they care about and what creates value. I wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and automate any task that does not need a human to perform it. I believed digitalization could unlock this potential—and so much more. Today, Estonia is the first country where all government services are 100% digital, and Nortal has grown into a global player, helping governments across North America, Europe and the Middle East create digital solutions that are citizen-centered, resilient, and deliver real outcomes. Many of my dreams have already come true, and I’m proud of our role in making that happen. But the world is changing faster than ever. Artificial intelligence, globalization, energy and climate crises, geopolitical tensions, and a generation of kids growing up in a fully digital world are reshaping what we expect from society. As the world changes, we need to have the will and courage to dream and reinvent the future we want our children to inherit. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO Delivering value across industries Public Sector Transforming governments in the digital age.

    "content": "Government efficiency in the age of AI This white paper explores how applying democratic design principles to digital infrastructure creates governments that are both more capable and more trusted. Get the white paper Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? The race between digital democracy and digital control Digital technology is redefining how governments operate. It can make institutions faster and more effective, or more centralized and opaque. The next decade will decide whether AI-enabled governments evolve as open, participatory systems or drift toward digital authoritarianism. The architecture built today will determine how freedom, trust and efficiency coexist in the decades to come. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. Explore system-level efficiency Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for whole-of-government system efficiency The paper introduces system-level efficiency as a new benchmark for digital governance. It measures performance not by speed or cost alone but by how well digital systems reinforce trust, capacity and adaptability across government. System-level efficiency arises when operational performance, state capacity and public trust advance together, constrained by four strategic factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Explore the new governance benchmark A roadmap to efficient digital democracy The white paper outlines three stages for governments pursuing both efficiency and legitimacy: Build a trusted foundation. Base registries, digital identity, data exchange and transparency tools give citizens confidence and control. Increase intelligence. Integrate systems to enable proactive, AI-supported services that remain explainable and fair. Prepare for democratic cyberocracy. Leverage data and AI for real-time governance while preserving oversight, participation and the rule of law. Democracy: the most efficient form of governance The paper’s conclusion is clear: democracy is not an obstacle to efficiency, it is its foundation. Its core principles, representation, accountability, transparency and subsidiarity, optimize outcomes and resource use across government. Embedded into digital architecture, these principles guide choices about open standards, federated data exchange and algorithmic transparency. Governments that design for both democracy and efficiency create systems that are more trusted, resilient and adaptive. The digital governments of the future will not only deliver better outcomes; they will strengthen the democratic fabric itself.

    "content": "Securing today, forging the defence of tomorrow: Through digital mastery. In a time where resilience is non-discretionary, we empower the Armed Forces and Defence Ministries to maintain operational advantage through data-led transformation. Get in touch! An area undergoing digital change The Nortal Factor Our experience building the world’s first digital government has established a scalable digital transformation and resilience model. This, coupled with our extensive catalogue of best practices across both public and private sectors, positions us uniquely in Europe, NATO, and globally. We can amplify existing digital, defensive cyber, and resilience practices within defence to build capacity and protect the supply chain, industry partners, and broader national security. This is not just an episodic national endeavour but a global necessity – the crises we face are international in scope, demanding cross-border collaboration and partnerships. Core capabilities All sectors need to consider how they contribute to an existential survival crisis. A symbiotic exchange between defence and broader public and private sector knowledge is required. We can make this a reality. Digital Transformation Digital transformation replaces outdated processes with streamlined, adaptive systems, empowering defence organisations to act with speed, precision, and agility. By achieving decision advantage, enhancing resilience, and outpacing evolving threats, it enables the shift from rigid inefficiency to dynamic capability-delivering unmatched operational superiority and securing the future of defence. Data Exploitation Exploitation unlocks the power of information, transforming complexity into clarity and raw data into actionable insights. By driving smarter decisions, operational precision, and strategic foresight, we equip defence organisations to strengthen resilience, maintain decision advantage, and gain the critical edge needed to stay ahead of evolving threats. Cyber Force Protection Cyber Force Protection is more than defence—it is a trusted partnership that transforms mindsets and builds resilience from strategy to implementation and beyond. We enable defence organisations to proactively secure critical systems, sustain operational continuity, and achieve superiority in the digital battlespace, ensuring success in a rapidly changing threat environment. Resilience Resilience underpins every aspect of modern defence and is the product of digital transformation, data exploitation and cyber force protection —ensuring systems, data, and operations can withstand, adapt, and thrive in the face of disruption. This forces a paradigm shift: embedding resilience at every level (technology, people, and process) we empower organisations to maintain decision advantage, secure mission success, and safeguard critical capabilities in an unpredictable digital world. In an ever-increasing threat environment, our dependency on technology and data is the ‘vital ground’ of 21st-century competition and conflicts. Nortal is uniquely positioned to translate a nation-state’s government digitisation into the defence of nations, coalitions, and alliances – harnessing R&D to deliver digital transformation, ensure resilience, and set conditions for cyber force protection. – Nick Washer, Global Head of Defence at Nortal Our portfolio We are uniquely positioned as a reliable partner in the aerospace and defence sector.

Download the full white paper Democratic stability and service continuity during crises We are living in times of multiple crises. Pandemics, conflicts, and climate change are testing the resilience of our institutions and democracy. Nearly 30% of governments in Europe had to postpone elections during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, highlighting the need for digital continuity of state functions in the face of challenges. As a result, policymakers are now making large investments into their digital capabilities to ensure the digital continuity of state functions during times of crisis. The future of resilient governance lies in building digital states that can operate and deliver services from anywhere, withstanding threats in both physical and virtual worlds. Learn more from our white paper Building digital resilience The seven key policies suggested in the study are intended to help build and strengthen the resilience of a state’s digital infrastructure. If built properly, a sufficiently resilient digital state could run its core and critical digital services even if there was a temporary or more long-term loss of its physical territory due to a crisis. To remain relevant, states must digitalize As states undergo the transformation into new digital states, it is of the utmost importance to think strategically about how to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure. These recommendations, if adopted, will help to ensure that a digital state can function even when facing the worst of crises. Digital-first approach to public services and registries related to the continuity of the state. Transition to public sector jobs that can operate in a remote-first or remote-enabled manner. Prioritizing the security of digital infrastructure and services. Resilience in connectivity by viewing internet access as critical infrastructure. Reduced opportunities for physical damage to disrupt their digital operations. Managed third-party risk without limiting opportunities for technological innovation. A whole-of-government approach to developing digital resilience. Dr Keegan McBride, Lecturer in AI, Government, and Policy, Oxford Internet Institute States that adopt our recommendations will be rewarded with a resilient digital state. This is something that is now only possible due to technology. It also represents the need to shift how we think about states in this new digital world where digital is no longer tied to the physical boundaries of a nation.

    "content": "From docks to data: Charting a course for cyber resilience in the smart port era New insights on securing hyper-connected ports against operational shutdowns, supply chain disruption, and escalating cyber threats. Get the white paper Service Cyber Resilience Industry Logistics The convergence of IT, OT, and emerging AI has unlocked unprecedented efficiency across port operations. At the same time, it has erased traditional security boundaries — introducing new forms of risk that extend far beyond data loss. Can smart ports deliver efficiency without exposing operations and global supply chains to systemic cyber risk? Cyber risk is no longer just digital Cyber threats are no longer confined to data theft; they now pose a direct risk of operational paralysis, physical sabotage, and systemic supply chain disruption that can ripple across the globe. A single, well-executed cyber incident can bring a major port to a standstill — incurring millions in losses per day and triggering cascading failures across international supply chains. Read the white paper €200k per hour is the estimated downtime cost for one large port in UK. €95B could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region 90% of port and terminal executives felt \"Very confident\" in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering... 45% of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach that year before. Despite clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within maritime leadership, creating one of the most significant strategic blind spots. When the perimeter disappears The traditional approach to cybersecurity, built around strong perimeters and assumed trust, is no longer sufficient in a hyper-connected port ecosystem. True resilience requires a shift from reactive, compliance-driven security toward strategies designed for an assumed-breach reality. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for maritime cyber resilience This white paper moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience — combining resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defence. It provides an actionable roadmap to help port leadership: Understand the modern cyber-physical threat landscape Reduce exposure across converged IT, OT, and third-party environments Build resilience that supports continuity, compliance, and trust Resilience as the new North Star Cybersecurity is no longer a back-office IT function or a cost centre.

    "title": "Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat",
    "content": "Home Insights Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Article March 13, 2025 James Thomas, Global Head of Cyber | Michael Hampson Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. Download the Embedding resilience paper Service Cyber Resilience Strategy and Transformation It’s not a question of if you will be attacked; it’s a question of when. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 99% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months A resilient culture This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience—embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer-centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. Investing in cyber resilience The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Measuring the impact €10.5tn is the predicted cost of cybercrime globally in 2025 €4.66m was the average cost of a data breach ion 2024 €4.76m was the average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 The cost of cyber resilience So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: How does the organisation make money or deliver value? What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/or services provided? What is the threat to each? Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. The building blocks of embedding resilience A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation. 01. Governance & strategy The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. Leadership commitment and clear accountability Risk management and asset identification (aligns with NIST’s Identify function and ISO’s context and leadership clauses) Integration of cyber resilience into business continuity planning Regular review and refinement of policies to address evolving threats Regulatory and legal compliance, mapping to relevant standards Organisational value alignment; cyber strategies support business objectives and value generation Reporting structures and escalation pathways Investment prioritization Operational dependency mapping Operational Impact analysis (BIA) 02. Protect & secure The traditional defen ce layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience. Deliberate security architectures aligned to organisational goals, objectives, and structures Resilience by design principles Supply chain security controls Security culture and capability development Access controls, encryption, and network security measures Endpoint and application security Regular vulnerability assessments, patch management, and continuous security and business alignment validation Alignment with the “Protect” function of NIST and the Annex A controls of ISO 27001 03. Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organ isation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements Supply chain security and third-party risk management Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements 04. Intelligence & adaptation A continuous learning loop that leverages threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defen ces and responses. The intelligence and adaption block ensures that organisations can systematically analyse the value of their current defences and make informed adjustments where necessary. Moreover, the adaption process involves internalizing lessons learned from post-incident reviews and active engagement with external intelligence sources and collaborative industry networks. This ensures that our organisations learn and grow from our own experiences and also from those of other organisations. It also ensures that we remain at the forefront of best practices and can continually refine our policies and processes to meet new challenges head-on. Proactive threat hunting and continuous monitoring Intelligence-led testing and validation Analytics, reporting, and feedback mechanisms Emerging Tech impact assessments Predictive analytics Incorporation of lessons learned into strategy, policy, and process updates Engagement with external intelligence sources and collaboration with industry peers Review of emerging threats and recommendations regarding strategy, policy, and process Embedding resilience To embed the cyber resilience process, we need to embrace erudition, constantly learn from our mistakes, and then adapt and apply those lessons to any given context, not once, not twice, but continuously. Cyber resilience can then be embedded through four distinct phases, constantly monitored as threats and risks evolve. Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping involves deeply examining an organisation’s purpose to understand the value it provides to stakeholders and to identify critical functions that must be maintained under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping help uncover how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing key interdependencies that affect resilience. This process extends to stakeholder relationships, offering a broader understanding of the organisation’s ecosystem, including its supply chain. By clarifying purpose and operations, mission mapping allows for the examination of assumptions, ultimately strengthening organisational resilience. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers. This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability.

    "content": "Home Insights Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Case study March 7, 2025 Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Technology alone cannot secure a government’s digital future, but trust in governance might be weaker without it. X-Road® helps governments regain control by strengthening trust between citizens and the state. Nortal has played a key role in building the digital foundation that keeps modern democracies running. Service Digital Trust Seamless Experiences Transformation Industry Public Sector Government Keeping chaos at bay In the digital age, the notion of “conflict” is expanding, and cyberattacks are an unavoidable part of the world’s new digital reality. For some, they are a daily occurrence. In 2007, Estonia suffered one of the first nationwide cyberattacks in the world. The massive assault, coming from Russia and aimed at destabilizing critical infrastructure, was a wake-up call for the young digital society. In response, Estonia swiftly enacted new cybersecurity laws, strengthened regulations, and invested heavily in improving digital infrastructure resiliency. This was a prescient move because cyberattacks never ceased. Estonia stands as one of the most cyber-targeted nations in the world, yet it has also become one of the most cyber-resilient and advanced digital nations. Despite relentless attempts to breach its systems, the country has maintained uninterrupted digital services. In most cases, Estonian residents have not been aware that the nation was under assault. What’s behind Estonia’s resilience? Strategic foresight, robust digital governance and a technological backbone designed for both security and scalability. At the core of it all is X-Road. Not built as a crisis management tool, but it works well in one Secure decentralized data exchange was the core principle for designing X-Road, and its architecture makes it inherently resilient in times of disruption. Built as a core component of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure (DPI) in 2001, X-Road was designed to enable secure, seamless, and efficient data exchange between government institutions and also with the private sector. Estonia’s ability to maintain uninterrupted digital services despite constant cyber threats has not only secured its own governance but has also positioned it as a model for others. As governments worldwide face similar challenges, many have turned to Estonia’s digital infrastructure for guidance. Today, X-Road is far more than a domestic solution—it has become a global de facto standard for secure data interoperability facilitated by governments. It has been adopted in more than 25 countries and territories, providing a robust foundation for secure data exchange across diverse regulatory environments. In Estonia alone, up to thousands of public and private sector organizations integrate with the local X-Road ecosystem called “X-tee” (X-Road’s original name in Estonian), leveraging its built-in security and efficiency to streamline operations and enhance citizen services. Among others, Ukraine has implemented a data-sharing ecosystem with a model similar to X-Road, known as Trembita, ensuring secure and uninterrupted digital government operations – even in times of crisis. Case study: Estonia While X-Road’s success is now global, its origins are deeply rooted in Estonia’s need to build an entirely new state from the ground up after regaining independence in 1991. The country was faced with the problem of having no systems at all—no digital infrastructure, no administration, no legal code—it was organizational chaos. But the nation did have visionary leaders, plus a host of engineers and cryptographers. It took the digital path. The X-Road ecosystem in Estonia is operated by the Information System Authority . X-Road has been in use for over two decades and made the nation a digital showcase, leading many to call it “the most digital society on earth.” From its inception, X-Road has been more than just a digital backbone—it is a cornerstone of Estonia’s cyber-resilience. Despite persistent cyber threats, including repeated attacks from Russian-linked actors, for over two decades, there has been no known major X-Road security breach or data leak. In its entire operational history in Estonia, X-Road has experienced only brief, partial disruptions affecting only individual services—an impressive track record for a nationwide digital infrastructure. At its inception in 2001, Estonian engineers designed X-Road to enable secure, cost-efficient data exchange within the government while minimizing system integration complexity. Rather than creating isolated connections between government agencies, Estonia developed a standardized, reusable infrastructure that operates securely over the public Internet. This approach ensured data sovereignty while enabling seamless interoperability between both public and private sector systems. In 2013, the Prime Ministers of Estonia and Finland signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on “developing and maintaining a software environment enabling secure connectivity, searches and data transfers between various governmental and private databases.” A couple of years later, in 2015, Finland adopted the system, and in 2017, Estonia and Finland further strengthened their cooperation by establishing the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) to oversee the development of X-Road as an open-source solution. As of December 2024, Estonia has achieved 100% digitalization of its government services, an unprecedented milestone in digital governance. In recent years, the country has rapidly advanced in the United Nations E-Government Development Index (EGDI), rising from 16th place in 2018 to 2nd in 2024. This achievement is more than just an improved ranking—it underscores the efficiency of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure, with X-Road at its core. Impacts: the world X-Road’s impact goes far beyond the Nordic countries. As digital governance becomes a global necessity, nations worldwide are turning to X-Road for its security, efficiency, and trust-building power. Beyond enabling seamless and secure data exchange, X-Road has far-reaching effects across multiple domains. From driving economic efficiency and strengthening trust through transparency to ensuring data sovereignty and promoting sustainable interoperability, its impact is reshaping how governments operate in the digital age. 01. Economics Although the exact economic impact of X-Road is difficult to measure, its benefits are undeniable. Estonia’s X-Road ecosystem processes approximately 295 million requests per month, with only 3% triggered by direct citizen interactions. If each request behind these interactions saves just 10 minutes, Estonia recovers an estimated 1.48 million hours of working time every month—an impressive gain for a nation with a relatively small population. The true efficiency boost is even greater, as most requests are machine-to-machine interactions that eliminate the need for manual processing. Across Estonia and other countries, X-Road has enabled automation and real-time data processing, increasing process efficiency more than fivefold in various sectors. The platform has also fostered robust public-private partnerships in Estonia by connecting around 1,000 institutions and enterprises, ultimately extending its value to an additional 52,000 organizations. The impact of X-Road can be seen not only within the nations that use it but also with their trading partners. With its Trust Federation feature, X-Road also facilitates cross-border data exchange, which is particularly beneficial for countries with close economic ties. The X-Road federation between Estonia and Finland allows for interoperability between their data exchange layers yet supports a complete interdependence between their economies. The federated data exchange smooths public service provision to citizens, workers, and entrepreneurs operating across borders. 02. Trust through impeccable security, transparency and equitable use of personal data X-Road’s impact goes beyond service delivery—it has become a foundation for trust between citizens and the state. When services are provided proactively, without requiring citizens to request them, efficiency becomes a trust-building tool. By ensuring individuals receive benefits and services as soon as they become eligible, X-Road plays a crucial role in shaping a more responsive and citizen-centric government. Beyond automation, X-Road has redefined transparency, accountability and the equitable use of personal data in digital governance. By unifying data exchange with X-Road, Estonia also introduced a data tracker that allows citizens to see who has accessed their personal data and for what purpose, enhancing transparency and control. This mechanism strengthens public trust by making errors and potential misuse both visible and reportable. Each transaction within the X-Road ecosystem is timestamped, cryptographically signed, and logged to ensure integrity while preserving privacy—no log data is shared with the governing entity, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure while tampering of the logs is made impossible. Only metadata (header) is collected and published as open data, with query and response content remaining private between the parties. The open-source nature of X-Road further reinforces trust, allowing independent verification of its security and functionality. 03. Sustainable interoperability X-Road plays a vital role in promoting sustainability by allowing governments to optimize resource use and enable secure, efficient data exchange with energy-efficient infrastructure. By reducing the need for dedicated, resource-intensive private networks and leveraging existing public Internet infrastructure, X-Road minimizes redundancy and enhances resource utilization across multiple stakeholders. Cloud-based Security Servers (software components acting as access points to the X-Road ecosystem) can further improve X-Road’s sustainability by reducing energy consumption by up to 88 per cent compared to on-premises solutions, benefiting from efficient resource allocation and energy-efficient data centres. Since X-Road is a cloud-ready solution, organizations can seamlessly transition to cloud environments to enhance both environmental and operational efficiency. With a long-term vision of becoming the world’s most sustainable data exchange solution of its kind, X-Road aims to align with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support eco-friendly digital transformation. 04. The public sector digitalization landscape The adoption of X-Road has accelerated Estonia’s public sector digitalization efforts by providing a consistent framework that simplifies system integration and addresses complex technical challenges such as secure data exchange, encryption, and audit trails. By using X-Road as the primary integration channel, development teams can save significant time by reusing a proven solution for data exchange. X-Road also strengthens security, compliance, and resilience by providing a comprehensive framework that aligns with industry best practices, including Zero Trust principles and data integrity assurance. Furthermore, it fosters innovation by simplifying collaboration across software teams, allowing them to focus on impactful solutions while providing access to shared services and interoperable solutions that promote partnerships between government agencies and private sector stakeholders. 05. Data sovereignty X-Road ensures strong data sovereignty by employing a decentralized architecture that allows organizations to retain full control over their data and data access services. Every information system owner operates through a dedicated access point component—an X-Road Security Server—preserving sovereignty and enforcing strict access controls. Government entities maintain ownership of their data while defining who can access it and under what conditions, reinforcing security and autonomy. This approach also eliminates reliance on central intermediaries, as data is transferred directly between the data provider and the consumer. The end-to-end encryption mechanism guarantees that data remains confidential and accessible only to its intended recipient, enhancing security and trust. X-Road allows organizations to retain full control over their data exchange while ensuring compliance with both national and international data protection laws. Ultimately, this decentralized and secure model strengthens digital autonomy while fostering seamless and reliable data interoperability. 06. Cyber resilience X-Road enhances cyber resilience through a combination of proven security measures—such as encryption and digital signing—alongside decentralized architecture and continuous security evaluations. Over several decades, X-Road’s security framework has successfully withstood numerous widespread cyber-attacks in Estonia, demonstrating its reliability and robustness. By leveraging X-Road’s established security foundation, development teams can focus on their core objectives without the burden of building security measures from scratch. To ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats, commercial cybersecurity specialists regularly assess the X-Road software through comprehensive evaluations, including architecture reviews, threat modelling, and penetration testing. A public bug bounty program further enhances X-Road’s security by ensuring continuous improvement and resilience. 07. Digital Public Goods The Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) provides X-Road as an open-source solution to support global digital development and promote equal access to digital infrastructure. X-Road is vetted by the Digital Public Goods Alliance to ensure it fulfils the criteria of a Digital Public Good.

Our solution integrates appointment data, optimizes room allocations based on factors like doctor movement, and seamlessly syncs results with Outlook calendars, using HL7 FHIR standard interfaces. The solution can be integrated with patient information systems, facility services, and other background systems. Personnel resource allocation planning – the cornerstone of efficient service delivery In industries where service delivery requires professionals with a variety of different skills and qualifications, an unnecessary amount of time and effort is spent on planning. Processes can be fragmented, and manual, and rely on the specialized knowledge and expertise of individual people. We have co-developed with our customers a solution utilizing MS Power Platform and Azure platforms. The benefits of the solution lie in centralized data management, where everyone can see the information according to their user role needs. Shared information flows through the system from one stage of the process to the next, reducing manual work and errors combined with the usage of historical data used as a basis for plans and for developing operations. Process automation in an industrial environment A manufacturing client suffered from a very manual, and therefore slow and error-prone, purchase order processing system which required manual conversion and data en try to an ERP system. To speed up and automate the process we did a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Proof of Concept (PoC) project to evaluate the compatibility of Microsoft Power Automate with Oracle EBS and assess the feasibility and benefits of automating our customer’s order creation process. Product m arketing data m anagement solution One of our manufacturing customers had an outdated system that was burdensome to manage, with manual steps and slow adaptation to changes.

At Nortal, we help you identify where and how the ServiceNow platform can make the biggest impact on your organization through our envisioning and roadmap service.

What is the difference between ITOM and ITSM? While both are strategies for IT management, ITOM and ITSM are separate concepts. ITOM describes the individual processes and services that are administered by an IT department—this includes administrative processes, support for hardware and software, and services for internal and external clients. On the other hand, ITSM includes what a company does to manage IT services through the entirety of the life cycle, including strategic planning, service operation, service desk, continual service improvement, and design building. ITSM also encompasses the help desk and fulfilment of IT requests that come from employees. Best practices of ITSM are known as the ITIL framework, which describes the life cycle of service in detail. ITOM is covered under the ITIL framework. ITOM teams are meant to focus on daily tasks for the operation of an organization’s infrastructure components and applications—all aspects of the service operation stage defined in the ITSM lifecycle."

Atlassian tools enable teams to plan projects, transfer knowledge, and track tasks. The big advantage is that the products are highly scalable and therefore suitable for both small and large organizations. Atlassian tools can also be integrated with many third-party providers. Other reasons for choosing the Atlassian product range include time-saving automation, centralization of information, and high security standards. Why does Nortal partner with Atlassian? The partnership between Nortal and Atlassian brings together the best of both worlds: Atlassian's powerful products and Nortal's expertise in implementation, configuration, and integration. How long does it take to implement Atlassian software? The duration of implementation depends heavily on individual requirements. With cloud implementation, standard setups and smaller teams can get started within a few days, while complex projects with self-hosted solutions and strict security requirements can take several weeks to months. How does the integration of Atlassian tools with existing systems work? Atlassian tools can be integrated with existing systems via already-active interfaces and Marketplace apps. Tools such as Microsoft Teams offer connectors for Atlassian products, while Atlassian provides APIs. Plugins from the Atlassian Marketplace enable connections to customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, for example. What licensing models does Atlassian offer? Atlassian offers two main licensing models: Cloud and Data Center. While the Atlassian-hosted Cloud solution is more suitable for companies that want quick implementation and easy setup, the self-hosted Data Center option is ideal for organizations that require advanced security features and must adhere to strict compliance guidelines. What technical skills does our team need to manage Atlassian products? Basic IT skills and tool-specific knowledge are required to manage Atlassian products. Knowledge of workflow and process management as well as cloud hosting is an advantage, and basic knowledge of scripting languages can also be useful. At Nortal , we always aim to transfer knowledge and want to enable you to use Atlassian tools profitably. Are Atlassian tools GDPR compliant? Yes, Atlassian tools are GDPR compliant. Atlassian implements strict data protection and security measures, including data encryption, user control, and audit functions. For cloud users, data can be stored in GDPR-compliant data centers. These features are also available for most third-party Marketplace apps. Our Atlassian experts can help you review and configure your tools and apps for compliance. How can we measure the ROI of Atlassian software? There are several ways to measure the ROI of Atlassian software: You can analyze the time savings achieved through automation or compare operating costs with those before Atlassian products were introduced. Employee satisfaction, which is strongly influenced by workflows and team communication, can also be an indicator ."

Oman e-Census 2020 is a great example of how technology can accelerate public services. The award was received by Dr. Khalifa bin Abdullah al Barwani, the CEO of NCSI, during a ceremony held on 6 May 2024 under the auspices of HH Shaikh Meshaal al Ahmad al Jaber al Sabah, the Emir of the State of Kuwait. During the acceptance, Dr. Barwani spotlighted the efforts that the NCSI has made in recent years to digitally transform national statistics to support decision-making. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff during the previous population count in 2010. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Read the story in the Oman Observer A fully register-based census In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts.

    "title": "Data-driven solution for safer and smarter operations at Valmet",
    "content": "Case study May 5, 2025 Data-driven solution for safer and smarter operations at Valmet After a fire caused a data loss in a test facility, Valmet committed to ensuring that no valuable test data would be at risk again. Through a pioneering partnership with Nortal, Valmet merged Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) to create a customized, resilient, data-driven solution that prioritizes safety and efficiency. This project is part of a larger initiative under Valmet’s Factory IT program, a new strategic focus area designed to enable business excellence through modular capabilities and a scalable, extendable IT service offering for factory operations. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Data and AI Valmet, a leading global developer and supplier of process technologies, automation, and services for the pulp, paper, and energy industries, ensures quality by rigorously testing its products in a precise testing environment equipped with hundreds of condition monitoring sensors. Valmet’s test bench has significantly more product-specific sensors than those found on the customer’s factory floor, ensuring product quality. A few years ago, a fire broke out at the Valmet Rautpohja factory in Finland during a roll test, destroying one of the test rigs used for testing paper machine rolls (SymRoll). Fires during roll testing are extremely rare, but in such uncommon situations it is important to ensure that test data is recovered to a safe location and easily accessible. “Back then, we stored local data near the operator’s room, and we weren’t able to save all our test run data,” says Timo Ollila , Product Manager, Deflection compensated rolls, Board and Paper Mills Business Unit, Valmet. “With our old system, only data about the last test runs was available, and not easily accessible either.” Capturing crucial data from roll test runs The test environment is an accurate and data critical environment, where accurate data collection is non-negotiable. Every sensor measurement and video feed are vital to understanding performance and ensuring safety. It’s in this environment where data concerning sensors, roll inspection, startup recipes, and video needs to be collected, captured, and transmitted to the cloud. Because any data that isn’t in the cloud is at risk of not being able to be efficiently analyzed. Timo Ollila’s brief to Nortal had three requirements: Valmet needed to collect accurate data and keep it in a safe place. The data needed to be available, meaning visible, visualizable, and not complicated to get. Valmet wanted a suite of tools that would deliver tangible business value to Valmet and enable them to effectively leverage their data. Valmet’s pioneering solution in the heavy industry Nortal’s Cloud Architect Anssi Pannula and the rest of the team set to work to develop an IT/OT integration using the latest technologies. “Our solution collects data from the new test rig at the Rautpohja factory using 3,000 sensor tags that measure temperature, speed, pressure, flow and vibration, among many others” says Pannula, “and all of it is sent to Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric in near real time. Video is captured by four cameras, and all footage is stored in OneLake in Microsoft Fabric. With OneLake File Explorer, users can easily open and view videos directly through Windows File Explorer on their laptop.” If a similar accident were to occur in the future, Valmet could now quickly grasp the sequence of events and restore normal production more efficiently, eliminating the need for extensive time and manual efforts to identify the cause. \"We can now use data to identify any issues in roll testing and take preventative actions with the future in mind”, says Ollila. Along with enhanced safety, this solution also enables Valmet to collect and analyze large amounts of data in near real time. This capability supports the evaluation of various test rig configurations and the comparison of test runs, helping to identify the optimal settings and parameters for more efficient operations. Ollila says that the system provides machine operators with visual dashboards on Grafana, also developed by Nortal, alongside their trending tools. “If something happens during the test run, they can contact the roll engineers. Telemetry data supports fact-based decision-making by showing detailed insights, such as pressure and flow patterns. We can see what happens and if there are any broken components in the roll, which if detected early, can mean huge cost savings. We can do full testing without building separate measuring units. All of this is made possible by the comprehensive solution Nortal has delivered.” Nortal’s Business Area Director, Petri Rönkkö, says that Valmet’s modern cloud-based solution is not that common in the heavy industry. “Consumer-facing businesses are quickly adopting cloud technologies and ways of working, but in manufacturing, factories still do a lot of manual work in a siloed local on-premises environments, each with their own tools and systems. These kinds of solutions offer a comprehensive view of what’s happening on the shop floor. Unlocking the data is great on the factory floor, but it also supports top management needs when data siloes are broken down.” – Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland Valmet’s solution is designed with scalability in mind. The same platform capabilities can be re-used in other use cases as well to save money in the future and avoid point solutions for each separate use case. A collaborative approach to success What made it possible to achieve all this in six months from start to finish? Valmet says it’s because of how the team was structured and worked together. Teemu Vento, Global Operations, Factory IT Lead, Valmet, calls this an agile way of working in cohesive collaboration. “It was an MVP, so neither party knew exactly what we’d discover. For me, the best thing was the ability to make decisions along the way .” “There were three players in the team,” says Timo Ollila. “Valmet business, Valmet IT, and Nortal. That meant we had to have an open dialogue during the development process. Together we defined and clarified our needs, made compromises and constantly discussed between the three parties to make an optimal solution. I’m a mechanical engineer, not an IT specialist. I define our needs and Nortal and Valmet IT turned those into technical solutions fit for Valmet’s factory environment. The co-operation was smooth and the active dialogue between parties was the key to success in this project.” Data-driven s cal e With more than 19,000 employees and 60 production units worldwide, Valmet is excited about the opportunities to scale this Data Collection and Visualization Solution to be used in other Valmet factories and different use cases in future. “We have plans to scale this solution and realize the benefits of the solution in wider at Valmet”, says Vento. “So far, we’ve tested many rolls with the new rig and the process continues. Over the next year, we’ll see the real benefits, as the biggest savings will come from the new way of running the rolls. With a semi-automated process, reaction times are improved, and it’s quicker to conduct tests.”, Ollila says. Ollila believes that the key to a successful project is properly describing its scope in as much detail as possible — the more work done up front, the smoother everything goes. From Nortal’s side, it might be said that if there’s one skill beyond IT that we’ve keenly developed and put into practice over our 35 years in the business, it’s the ability to listen.

    "content": "Home Insights How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Case study October 16, 2024 How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Estonia is considered one of the most advanced digitized countries in the world. Not only are the citizens more open to new technologies, but the state has also made its point to always be ahead of the curve. The government proceedings have been paperless for almost 20 years and the parliament has used AI-supported transcriptions of its proceedings for over five years. Now it was time to speed up the legislative work of the parliament with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Service Data and AI Industry Government The parliament of Estonia, the Riigikogu, is the representative body of Estonia that among other things passes legislation like acts and resolutions and ratifies and denounces foreign treaties that impose military and proprietary obligations and bring about changes in law. Acts create the rules for different fields of life in Estonia upon which the functioning of the state is based. Working on acts with the lawyers of Riigikogu’s chancellery is therefore the most important and also the most time-consuming task of the Riigikogu. So, the chancellery of the Riigikogu needed a solution that would bring more efficacy to their legal department. Mountains of data The chancellery of the Riigikogu provides the conditions necessary for the parliament to perform its constitutional functions. While the proceeding of bills is the key task of the Riigikogu, the legal and research department advises all the 101 members of the Riigikogu, the board, the committees, the parliamentary groups and the employees working for them in order that the discussion in the parliament would be knowledge-based. The department replies to the information requests of the MPs, presents its opinions and analyses draft legislation, explanatory memoranda and other procedural documents proceeded by the Riigikogu. They also reply to information queries from the public. Thus far all the inquiries were addressed manually and one by one by the lawyers. With the vast amount of data generated and stored by the Riigikogu, traditional methods of document retrieval are time-consuming, laborious and prone to errors, and don’t provide a good user experience for fact checking. The solution needed to address these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) into a robust, user-friendly chatbot interface, streamlining access to information and enhancing decision-making processes. Intelligent search with legislative credibility We created a Nortal Tark based intelligent search solution MVP for the Chancellery of the Riigikogu that works in their internal web within the MS Azure infrastructure. Nortal Tark works through all the documents that lawyers used to search for answers manually before, e.g., the bill information system with all the legislative documents, including the European Union ones, previous official inquiries and answers, chancellery’s public documents etc. Tark translates the incoming question for the database inquiry, finds the answer, and presents it to the respective lawyer with references to the original documents. The lawyer can then use the presented information to, for example, formulate an answer to an inquiry or compile topic sheets for the MPs. Almost all the data involved with acts is public in Estonia and this first version of Riigikogu’s Nortal Tark implementation uses only public data . A country’s legislative body produces a lot of documents, even when the country is as forward-thinking and thin in bureaucracy as Estonia. So, the data that needed to be worked through for the implementation was colossal. The intelligent search application also takes into consideration the legislative credibility dimension. The aim is to pinpoint the most reliable source for inquiries, because what answers to the text search criteria, might not be the right answer from the lawyers’ perspective. For example, a simple search might come up with a document containing a similar question in it, but the lawyer needs an answer from a legislative document. Karl-Morten Koppel, Head of IT systems of the Parliament of Estonia \"This project has provided us with valuable insights into current AI models and their capabilities. It marks an important step in identifying how and where AI can be most effectively applied to maximize benefits, with the goal of improving both efficiency and the quality of services in the future, allowing citizens, MPs, and parliamentary staff to save time and work more productively.\" The main benefits of the intelligent search for Riigikogu Better user experience New, innovative solution Cost-effectiveness from timesaving Fast support One of the primary advantages of this intelligent search system is its ability to retrieve documents quickly and accurately, which makes answering inquiries faster. Users can interact with the chatbot using natural language queries, reducing the need for extensive manual searches or specific expertise. This significantly reduces the time spent digging up documents, allowing the chancellery staff to focus more on important matters. The intelligent search function for the chancellery of the Riigikogu is just the first step to test the waters of how the Riigikogu can benefit from genAI in the substantial work that they do. The next possible steps include making the application available to more people within the Riigikogu, moving it on-premises and adding internal data with corresponding access management to the system. The version with the public data could then be expanded to public use for the queries they might have for the Riigikogu.

    "content": "Home Insights Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Case study September 2, 2024 Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Nortal introduces an API-based solution to enable more efficient energy management to support Outokumpu’s ambitious sustainability goals. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Outokumpu is the global leader in sustainable stainless steel. Stainless steel operations are energy intensive, so Outokumpu uses the best available technology, electric arc furnaces, and continuously strives to make its production operations more energy efficient. In fact, Outokumpu’s biggest plant, located in Tornio, Finland, is the biggest single energy user in the Nordics. In general, to produce a ton of stainless steel in an electric arc furnace requires about 440 kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough to power hundreds of homes for an entire month. This is to say that when a company like Outokumpu turns its attention to saving energy, it is more than just a gesture—it is of global significance. By the end of 2024, the company’s goal is to improve energy efficiency by eight percent compared to a similar period two years prior. This will equate to an energy saving of around 600,000 megawatt hours, enough to power 15,000 households. Part of what makes this possible is Nortal helping Outokumpu feed the right data to their energy management system (EMS). Harnessing the power of data The problem is that data systems are many and diverse, with various downstream locations for data needed in the EMS. Data from manufacturing execution systems and other factory floor systems, such as maintenance breaks and production planning are needed for efficient energy management. Nortal created an API that combines the data sources and channels in to the EMS in close to real-time. Harnessing multiple sources of data, creating a harmonized API layer, and doing it fast, means that the savings can be staggering for a company that purchases energy on the spot market. “Outokumpu’s sustainability strategy aims at decarbonization and supporting customers to reduce their supply chain emissions,” says Harri Salo , Outokumpu’s Manager – Energy, Electrical and Crane Services. “Integration of the energy management system greatly supports this strategy. It enables us to measure electricity consumption, providing data that enables the possibility to adjust and optimize electricity usage. Additionally, this capability improves the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts and allows us to enhance our cost efficiency in production.” Beyond cost savings Energy and cost savings are of course important, but Outokumpu has even bigger aspirations. “Yes, EMS is a major scalable solution, which will save energy,” says Junhui Wang , Outokumpu’s Head of Data Platforms & Integrations. “But it’s much more than that. The EMS leverages our API strategy. It’s one of the enablers of our sustainability strategy, the cornerstone in our API strategy and governance.” What this means is that the solution is scalable and can be taken beyond the Tornio plant. It also supports the production of Outokumpu’s spearhead climate solution, Outokumpu Circle Green®, a product line with up to 93 percent lower carbon footprint compared to the global industry average*. Outokumpu calculates that if all stainless steel was produced in the same way, then global carbon emissions from the entire stainless steel value chain could be reduced by 364 million tons per year, or roughly 900 million one-way flights of a passenger from London to New York. “Outokumpu’s aim is to remain as the global leader in sustainable stainless steel,” says Harri Salo. “And we’re committed to keep the global warming at 1.5 ºC according to the Science-Based Targets Initiative”. *) Global average CO₂ emissions (2023): 7 kg CO₂e per kg of stainless steel (Outokumpu’s calculation based on data provided by CRU, worldstainless and Kobolde & Partners AB). Outokumpu Circle Green CO₂ emissions: down to 0.5 kilos of CO₂e per kg of stainless steel. Strategic partnership Helping to pave the way for advances in the steel industry digitalization is Nortal, who has worked in the metals sector for almost 40 years, much of that time with Outokumpu. “EMS is an excellent example of a solution that drives our customer’s high-level enterprise architecture and integration strategy forward while introducing clear business benefits”, says Jarkko Enden , CTO of Nortal Finland. “Long strategic partnerships, such as the one we have with Outokumpu, are a unique trait of Nortal Finland that we’re especially proud of.” – Junhui Wang, Head of Data Platforms & Integrations, Outokumpu Nortal has been a pivotal partner for Outokumpu, providing significant support in implementing our integration and API strategy over the past years. Our integration landscape, characterized by a diverse array of technologies and tools, has been complex. With Nortal's expertise, we are now on the right path towards achieving our North Star Integration Architecture.

    "content": "Home Insights Battling pandemics with the help of AI Case study October 9, 2024 Battling pandemics with the help of AI In a national health crisis, the population’s need for fast, professional, and trustworthy advice skyrockets. Even with seasonal illnesses, the increase in inquiries is sudden, burdening the phone lines of health offices. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) needed a futureproof solution to make communication with the citizens more efficient. Enter Artificial Intelligence. Service Data and AI Industry Healthcare Lower Saxony has a population of eight million, making it the fourth largest state in population among Germany’s 16 states. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) is the state’s central authority for communicable and non-communicable diseases and health risks. The NGLA aims to promote and protect the health of the people of Lower Saxony. 1 week, 1000 phone calls When COVID-19 hit Germany, the Lower Saxony state health office’s phone lines were overflooded with people hungry for information about this fast-spreading new disease. The health office received well over 1000 telephone inquiries a week. The delegation of calls via a switchboard could not be handled due to the overload, both in terms of personnel and infrastructure. However, the majority of the calls had identical questions that could have been answered using standardized templates. Given that the last four pandemics occurred almost every 15 years on average, and some believe that pandemics have been happening more often in recent decades, the NLGA needed a solution that would be futureproof not overcrowding their phone lines again, but still giving people the information and peace of mind that they needed. Efficacy through the secure use of AI We developed an AI-based chat and voice bot for the Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) built on our AI solution Nortal Tark . With the help of the intelligent assistant named Nova , citizens can ask NLGA questions around the clock while relieving the health department’s employees of some of the work burden. Users can call up the chatbot on the NLGA website , ask their questions, and receive an answer within seconds, for example, on specific diseases such as COVID-19 or measles or even recommendations on what to do in the case of head lice. This turnkey solution has the secure use of AI at its core – on a secure database that the NLGA controls 100 percent. Nova collects information from several knowledge sources, which the NLGA previously views, checks, and selects. The database is, therefore, professionally curated, can be constantly expanded by NLGA, and protected against data misuse. The intelligent assistant quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content, making communication with the citizens futureproof. It answers standard questions in various languages ​​and in the NLGA’s tone. Dr. Fabian Feil, President of the NLGA \"We are proud to be the first authority in Lower Saxony to launch an AI-supported chatbot, thus significantly improving communication with citizens even in the event of a crisis. A big thank you goes to our colleagues at Nortal, who were able to accurately identify our needs and, together with our team, in a very short time created a more than competitive solution using new technology.\" 24-hour service with minimal burden The project makes the NLGA a digital pioneer in the public sector. It exemplifies how generative AI and large language models (LLMs) can be used in administrative authorities. Employees’ time answering simple inquiries is reduced, which is particularly helpful in crises during epidemics or seasonal illnesses. The more efficient processing of queries leaves them more time to focus on more complex tasks and inquiries. The benefits of implementing Nova Good user experience Users can easily access the chatbot on the NLGA website, benefitting from a 24-hour chat service without language barriers. Futureproof With the help of generative AI and LLMs, the chatbot quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content.

    "title": "AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel",
    "content": "Home Insights AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Case study June 25, 2024 AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Artificial intelligence is much talked about, but solutions running in production are rare. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest stainless steel producer, turned to Nortal, its trusted partner for decades, to create a business-critical AI solution that is set to be scaled globally. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources While steel has been manufactured for a thousand years, stainless steel wasn’t created until the early 1900s. And given its complex chemical post-processing procedure, engineers and scientists have never stopped trying to perfect it. Challenge Surface defects cannot be avoided even in the most sophisticated production facilities. However, by detecting these defects early in the process, it is possible to better ensure that the customer gets the right quality required for their needs. Whenever a stainless steel surface is on display, such as on a building’s façade, it must be flawless. A car part hidden from view, however, can tolerate some defects. The key is to make sure the quality produced matches the end user’s needs, ensuring both a happy customer and a profitable business. There is a significant business advantage for manufacturers able to identify surface issues as far upstream as possible, allowing preventive action, reduced cost of reprocessing, and right-quality products routed to customers. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest producer of stainless steel, turned to Nortal to develop an advanced surface inspection system (ASIS) that could be scaled globally to other Outokumpu sites. Nortal is Outokumpu’s partner for its Global Data Platform, enabling seamless collaboration in the scaling processes. Solution Understanding defects and root causes like never before “A defect in hot rolling can extend further down to cold rolling, and a scratch can elongate to several meters,” explains Maximilian Hartmann , ASIS project manager from Outokumpu. “Understanding how defects occur helps us improve processes and take action early enough so we’re not doing unnecessary rework.” Beginning in October 2024, Outokumpu’s Tornio plant will switch to an altogether new version of an ASIS system which uses AI and Machine Learning to identify defects. “Human inspectors can’t evaluate a coil to the same degree of detail and consistency that a machine learning system can,” says Hartmann. “The renewed ASIS system supports inspectors in evaluating the full coil beyond what bare human eye can detect.” Constructing the new version of ASIS system was especially complicated, since building from scratch was not an option. First, a proof-of-concept ASIS system built by a previous vendor needed to be stabilized. The team utilized as much of the existing solution as possible but were required to re-engineer the application’s hybrid cloud architecture from scratch in order to meet the high availability requirements for the application. As a production-critical solution, ASIS must run even in scenarios when the internet is down, adding to the complexity of the required technology architecture. Nortal’s Senior Data Scientist, Erkki Alamäe, greatly enhanced the AI-based defect detection model, enabling the team to integrate it more tightly into the solution and significantly raise the level of automation in the defect detection process. Result Nortal’s solution unlocks massive benefits “Surface quality is one of the most important parameters of stainless steel production. The new version of the ASIS is a system we can scale globally and use the Machine Learning model to help the operators’ work in production without relying solely on manual labor to ensure right quality for every customer,” says Hartmann. The benefits are many. Customers get the quality they require, production planning and flow are optimized, and coils with problems are repaired or rerouted. Defects identified earlier mean lower costs, plus long-term benefits thanks to the identification of root causes. It’s a multisite solution that will allow quality information for coils to be transferred between various Outokumpu sites in Europe. Additionally, there are significant savings in storage costs, rejected materials, and through fewer customer claims. – Maximilian Hartmann, ASIS Project Manager Outokumpu I’m really happy how the development has gone with Nortal. We always moved constructively in the right direction. The way of working is clean, well-organized, and people talk openly.
