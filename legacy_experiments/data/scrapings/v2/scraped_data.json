A culture of growth and meaningful work Leadership Founder's perspective I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO The opportunity to reshape the future is now I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap. I envisioned a society where everything just works. Everything happens in the background seamlessly, so citizens and businesses can focus on what truly matters—what they care about and what creates value. I wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and automate any task that does not need a human to perform it. I believed digitalization could unlock this potential—and so much more. Today, Estonia is the first country where all government services are 100% digital, and Nortal has grown into a global player, helping governments across North America, Europe and the Middle East create digital solutions that are citizen-centered, resilient, and deliver real outcomes. Many of my dreams have already come true, and I’m proud of our role in making that happen. But the world is changing faster than ever. Artificial intelligence, globalization, energy and climate crises, geopolitical tensions, and a generation of kids growing up in a fully digital world are reshaping what we expect from society. As the world changes, we need to have the will and courage to dream and reinvent the future we want our children to inherit. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO Delivering value across industries Public Sector Transforming governments in the digital age.

    "content": "Government efficiency in the age of AI This white paper explores how applying democratic design principles to digital infrastructure creates governments that are both more capable and more trusted. Get the white paper Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? The race between digital democracy and digital control Digital technology is redefining how governments operate. It can make institutions faster and more effective, or more centralized and opaque. The next decade will decide whether AI-enabled governments evolve as open, participatory systems or drift toward digital authoritarianism. The architecture built today will determine how freedom, trust and efficiency coexist in the decades to come. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. Explore system-level efficiency Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for whole-of-government system efficiency The paper introduces system-level efficiency as a new benchmark for digital governance. It measures performance not by speed or cost alone but by how well digital systems reinforce trust, capacity and adaptability across government. System-level efficiency arises when operational performance, state capacity and public trust advance together, constrained by four strategic factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Explore the new governance benchmark A roadmap to efficient digital democracy The white paper outlines three stages for governments pursuing both efficiency and legitimacy: Build a trusted foundation. Base registries, digital identity, data exchange and transparency tools give citizens confidence and control. Increase intelligence. Integrate systems to enable proactive, AI-supported services that remain explainable and fair. Prepare for democratic cyberocracy. Leverage data and AI for real-time governance while preserving oversight, participation and the rule of law. Democracy: the most efficient form of governance The paper’s conclusion is clear: democracy is not an obstacle to efficiency, it is its foundation. Its core principles, representation, accountability, transparency and subsidiarity, optimize outcomes and resource use across government. Embedded into digital architecture, these principles guide choices about open standards, federated data exchange and algorithmic transparency. Governments that design for both democracy and efficiency create systems that are more trusted, resilient and adaptive. The digital governments of the future will not only deliver better outcomes; they will strengthen the democratic fabric itself.

    "content": "Securing today, forging the defence of tomorrow: Through digital mastery. In a time where resilience is non-discretionary, we empower the Armed Forces and Defence Ministries to maintain operational advantage through data-led transformation. Get in touch! An area undergoing digital change The Nortal Factor Our experience building the world’s first digital government has established a scalable digital transformation and resilience model. This, coupled with our extensive catalogue of best practices across both public and private sectors, positions us uniquely in Europe, NATO, and globally. We can amplify existing digital, defensive cyber, and resilience practices within defence to build capacity and protect the supply chain, industry partners, and broader national security. This is not just an episodic national endeavour but a global necessity – the crises we face are international in scope, demanding cross-border collaboration and partnerships. Core capabilities All sectors need to consider how they contribute to an existential survival crisis. A symbiotic exchange between defence and broader public and private sector knowledge is required. We can make this a reality. Digital Transformation Digital transformation replaces outdated processes with streamlined, adaptive systems, empowering defence organisations to act with speed, precision, and agility. By achieving decision advantage, enhancing resilience, and outpacing evolving threats, it enables the shift from rigid inefficiency to dynamic capability-delivering unmatched operational superiority and securing the future of defence. Data Exploitation Exploitation unlocks the power of information, transforming complexity into clarity and raw data into actionable insights. By driving smarter decisions, operational precision, and strategic foresight, we equip defence organisations to strengthen resilience, maintain decision advantage, and gain the critical edge needed to stay ahead of evolving threats. Cyber Force Protection Cyber Force Protection is more than defence—it is a trusted partnership that transforms mindsets and builds resilience from strategy to implementation and beyond. We enable defence organisations to proactively secure critical systems, sustain operational continuity, and achieve superiority in the digital battlespace, ensuring success in a rapidly changing threat environment. Resilience Resilience underpins every aspect of modern defence and is the product of digital transformation, data exploitation and cyber force protection —ensuring systems, data, and operations can withstand, adapt, and thrive in the face of disruption. This forces a paradigm shift: embedding resilience at every level (technology, people, and process) we empower organisations to maintain decision advantage, secure mission success, and safeguard critical capabilities in an unpredictable digital world. In an ever-increasing threat environment, our dependency on technology and data is the ‘vital ground’ of 21st-century competition and conflicts. Nortal is uniquely positioned to translate a nation-state’s government digitisation into the defence of nations, coalitions, and alliances – harnessing R&D to deliver digital transformation, ensure resilience, and set conditions for cyber force protection. – Nick Washer, Global Head of Defence at Nortal Our portfolio We are uniquely positioned as a reliable partner in the aerospace and defence sector.

Download the full white paper Democratic stability and service continuity during crises We are living in times of multiple crises. Pandemics, conflicts, and climate change are testing the resilience of our institutions and democracy. Nearly 30% of governments in Europe had to postpone elections during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, highlighting the need for digital continuity of state functions in the face of challenges. As a result, policymakers are now making large investments into their digital capabilities to ensure the digital continuity of state functions during times of crisis. The future of resilient governance lies in building digital states that can operate and deliver services from anywhere, withstanding threats in both physical and virtual worlds. Learn more from our white paper Building digital resilience The seven key policies suggested in the study are intended to help build and strengthen the resilience of a state’s digital infrastructure. If built properly, a sufficiently resilient digital state could run its core and critical digital services even if there was a temporary or more long-term loss of its physical territory due to a crisis. To remain relevant, states must digitalize As states undergo the transformation into new digital states, it is of the utmost importance to think strategically about how to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure. These recommendations, if adopted, will help to ensure that a digital state can function even when facing the worst of crises. Digital-first approach to public services and registries related to the continuity of the state. Transition to public sector jobs that can operate in a remote-first or remote-enabled manner. Prioritizing the security of digital infrastructure and services. Resilience in connectivity by viewing internet access as critical infrastructure. Reduced opportunities for physical damage to disrupt their digital operations. Managed third-party risk without limiting opportunities for technological innovation. A whole-of-government approach to developing digital resilience. Dr Keegan McBride, Lecturer in AI, Government, and Policy, Oxford Internet Institute States that adopt our recommendations will be rewarded with a resilient digital state. This is something that is now only possible due to technology. It also represents the need to shift how we think about states in this new digital world where digital is no longer tied to the physical boundaries of a nation.

    "content": "From docks to data: Charting a course for cyber resilience in the smart port era New insights on securing hyper-connected ports against operational shutdowns, supply chain disruption, and escalating cyber threats. Get the white paper Service Cyber Resilience Industry Logistics The convergence of IT, OT, and emerging AI has unlocked unprecedented efficiency across port operations. At the same time, it has erased traditional security boundaries — introducing new forms of risk that extend far beyond data loss. Can smart ports deliver efficiency without exposing operations and global supply chains to systemic cyber risk? Cyber risk is no longer just digital Cyber threats are no longer confined to data theft; they now pose a direct risk of operational paralysis, physical sabotage, and systemic supply chain disruption that can ripple across the globe. A single, well-executed cyber incident can bring a major port to a standstill — incurring millions in losses per day and triggering cascading failures across international supply chains. Read the white paper €200k per hour is the estimated downtime cost for one large port in UK. €95B could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region 90% of port and terminal executives felt \"Very confident\" in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering... 45% of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach that year before. Despite clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within maritime leadership, creating one of the most significant strategic blind spots. When the perimeter disappears The traditional approach to cybersecurity, built around strong perimeters and assumed trust, is no longer sufficient in a hyper-connected port ecosystem. True resilience requires a shift from reactive, compliance-driven security toward strategies designed for an assumed-breach reality. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for maritime cyber resilience This white paper moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience — combining resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defence. It provides an actionable roadmap to help port leadership: Understand the modern cyber-physical threat landscape Reduce exposure across converged IT, OT, and third-party environments Build resilience that supports continuity, compliance, and trust Resilience as the new North Star Cybersecurity is no longer a back-office IT function or a cost centre.

    "title": "Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat",
    "content": "Home Insights Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Article March 13, 2025 James Thomas, Global Head of Cyber | Michael Hampson Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. Download the Embedding resilience paper Service Cyber Resilience Strategy and Transformation It’s not a question of if you will be attacked; it’s a question of when. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 99% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months A resilient culture This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience—embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer-centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. Investing in cyber resilience The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Measuring the impact €10.5tn is the predicted cost of cybercrime globally in 2025 €4.66m was the average cost of a data breach ion 2024 €4.76m was the average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 The cost of cyber resilience So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: How does the organisation make money or deliver value? What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/or services provided? What is the threat to each? Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. The building blocks of embedding resilience A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation. 01. Governance & strategy The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. Leadership commitment and clear accountability Risk management and asset identification (aligns with NIST’s Identify function and ISO’s context and leadership clauses) Integration of cyber resilience into business continuity planning Regular review and refinement of policies to address evolving threats Regulatory and legal compliance, mapping to relevant standards Organisational value alignment; cyber strategies support business objectives and value generation Reporting structures and escalation pathways Investment prioritization Operational dependency mapping Operational Impact analysis (BIA) 02. Protect & secure The traditional defen ce layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience. Deliberate security architectures aligned to organisational goals, objectives, and structures Resilience by design principles Supply chain security controls Security culture and capability development Access controls, encryption, and network security measures Endpoint and application security Regular vulnerability assessments, patch management, and continuous security and business alignment validation Alignment with the “Protect” function of NIST and the Annex A controls of ISO 27001 03. Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organ isation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements Supply chain security and third-party risk management Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements 04. Intelligence & adaptation A continuous learning loop that leverages threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defen ces and responses. The intelligence and adaption block ensures that organisations can systematically analyse the value of their current defences and make informed adjustments where necessary. Moreover, the adaption process involves internalizing lessons learned from post-incident reviews and active engagement with external intelligence sources and collaborative industry networks. This ensures that our organisations learn and grow from our own experiences and also from those of other organisations. It also ensures that we remain at the forefront of best practices and can continually refine our policies and processes to meet new challenges head-on. Proactive threat hunting and continuous monitoring Intelligence-led testing and validation Analytics, reporting, and feedback mechanisms Emerging Tech impact assessments Predictive analytics Incorporation of lessons learned into strategy, policy, and process updates Engagement with external intelligence sources and collaboration with industry peers Review of emerging threats and recommendations regarding strategy, policy, and process Embedding resilience To embed the cyber resilience process, we need to embrace erudition, constantly learn from our mistakes, and then adapt and apply those lessons to any given context, not once, not twice, but continuously. Cyber resilience can then be embedded through four distinct phases, constantly monitored as threats and risks evolve. Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping involves deeply examining an organisation’s purpose to understand the value it provides to stakeholders and to identify critical functions that must be maintained under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping help uncover how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing key interdependencies that affect resilience. This process extends to stakeholder relationships, offering a broader understanding of the organisation’s ecosystem, including its supply chain. By clarifying purpose and operations, mission mapping allows for the examination of assumptions, ultimately strengthening organisational resilience. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers. This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability.

    "content": "Home Insights Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Case study March 7, 2025 Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Technology alone cannot secure a government’s digital future, but trust in governance might be weaker without it. X-Road® helps governments regain control by strengthening trust between citizens and the state. Nortal has played a key role in building the digital foundation that keeps modern democracies running. Service Digital Trust Seamless Experiences Transformation Industry Public Sector Government Keeping chaos at bay In the digital age, the notion of “conflict” is expanding, and cyberattacks are an unavoidable part of the world’s new digital reality. For some, they are a daily occurrence. In 2007, Estonia suffered one of the first nationwide cyberattacks in the world. The massive assault, coming from Russia and aimed at destabilizing critical infrastructure, was a wake-up call for the young digital society. In response, Estonia swiftly enacted new cybersecurity laws, strengthened regulations, and invested heavily in improving digital infrastructure resiliency. This was a prescient move because cyberattacks never ceased. Estonia stands as one of the most cyber-targeted nations in the world, yet it has also become one of the most cyber-resilient and advanced digital nations. Despite relentless attempts to breach its systems, the country has maintained uninterrupted digital services. In most cases, Estonian residents have not been aware that the nation was under assault. What’s behind Estonia’s resilience? Strategic foresight, robust digital governance and a technological backbone designed for both security and scalability. At the core of it all is X-Road. Not built as a crisis management tool, but it works well in one Secure decentralized data exchange was the core principle for designing X-Road, and its architecture makes it inherently resilient in times of disruption. Built as a core component of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure (DPI) in 2001, X-Road was designed to enable secure, seamless, and efficient data exchange between government institutions and also with the private sector. Estonia’s ability to maintain uninterrupted digital services despite constant cyber threats has not only secured its own governance but has also positioned it as a model for others. As governments worldwide face similar challenges, many have turned to Estonia’s digital infrastructure for guidance. Today, X-Road is far more than a domestic solution—it has become a global de facto standard for secure data interoperability facilitated by governments. It has been adopted in more than 25 countries and territories, providing a robust foundation for secure data exchange across diverse regulatory environments. In Estonia alone, up to thousands of public and private sector organizations integrate with the local X-Road ecosystem called “X-tee” (X-Road’s original name in Estonian), leveraging its built-in security and efficiency to streamline operations and enhance citizen services. Among others, Ukraine has implemented a data-sharing ecosystem with a model similar to X-Road, known as Trembita, ensuring secure and uninterrupted digital government operations – even in times of crisis. Case study: Estonia While X-Road’s success is now global, its origins are deeply rooted in Estonia’s need to build an entirely new state from the ground up after regaining independence in 1991. The country was faced with the problem of having no systems at all—no digital infrastructure, no administration, no legal code—it was organizational chaos. But the nation did have visionary leaders, plus a host of engineers and cryptographers. It took the digital path. The X-Road ecosystem in Estonia is operated by the Information System Authority . X-Road has been in use for over two decades and made the nation a digital showcase, leading many to call it “the most digital society on earth.” From its inception, X-Road has been more than just a digital backbone—it is a cornerstone of Estonia’s cyber-resilience. Despite persistent cyber threats, including repeated attacks from Russian-linked actors, for over two decades, there has been no known major X-Road security breach or data leak. In its entire operational history in Estonia, X-Road has experienced only brief, partial disruptions affecting only individual services—an impressive track record for a nationwide digital infrastructure. At its inception in 2001, Estonian engineers designed X-Road to enable secure, cost-efficient data exchange within the government while minimizing system integration complexity. Rather than creating isolated connections between government agencies, Estonia developed a standardized, reusable infrastructure that operates securely over the public Internet. This approach ensured data sovereignty while enabling seamless interoperability between both public and private sector systems. In 2013, the Prime Ministers of Estonia and Finland signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on “developing and maintaining a software environment enabling secure connectivity, searches and data transfers between various governmental and private databases.” A couple of years later, in 2015, Finland adopted the system, and in 2017, Estonia and Finland further strengthened their cooperation by establishing the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) to oversee the development of X-Road as an open-source solution. As of December 2024, Estonia has achieved 100% digitalization of its government services, an unprecedented milestone in digital governance. In recent years, the country has rapidly advanced in the United Nations E-Government Development Index (EGDI), rising from 16th place in 2018 to 2nd in 2024. This achievement is more than just an improved ranking—it underscores the efficiency of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure, with X-Road at its core. Impacts: the world X-Road’s impact goes far beyond the Nordic countries. As digital governance becomes a global necessity, nations worldwide are turning to X-Road for its security, efficiency, and trust-building power. Beyond enabling seamless and secure data exchange, X-Road has far-reaching effects across multiple domains. From driving economic efficiency and strengthening trust through transparency to ensuring data sovereignty and promoting sustainable interoperability, its impact is reshaping how governments operate in the digital age. 01. Economics Although the exact economic impact of X-Road is difficult to measure, its benefits are undeniable. Estonia’s X-Road ecosystem processes approximately 295 million requests per month, with only 3% triggered by direct citizen interactions. If each request behind these interactions saves just 10 minutes, Estonia recovers an estimated 1.48 million hours of working time every month—an impressive gain for a nation with a relatively small population. The true efficiency boost is even greater, as most requests are machine-to-machine interactions that eliminate the need for manual processing. Across Estonia and other countries, X-Road has enabled automation and real-time data processing, increasing process efficiency more than fivefold in various sectors. The platform has also fostered robust public-private partnerships in Estonia by connecting around 1,000 institutions and enterprises, ultimately extending its value to an additional 52,000 organizations. The impact of X-Road can be seen not only within the nations that use it but also with their trading partners. With its Trust Federation feature, X-Road also facilitates cross-border data exchange, which is particularly beneficial for countries with close economic ties. The X-Road federation between Estonia and Finland allows for interoperability between their data exchange layers yet supports a complete interdependence between their economies. The federated data exchange smooths public service provision to citizens, workers, and entrepreneurs operating across borders. 02. Trust through impeccable security, transparency and equitable use of personal data X-Road’s impact goes beyond service delivery—it has become a foundation for trust between citizens and the state. When services are provided proactively, without requiring citizens to request them, efficiency becomes a trust-building tool. By ensuring individuals receive benefits and services as soon as they become eligible, X-Road plays a crucial role in shaping a more responsive and citizen-centric government. Beyond automation, X-Road has redefined transparency, accountability and the equitable use of personal data in digital governance. By unifying data exchange with X-Road, Estonia also introduced a data tracker that allows citizens to see who has accessed their personal data and for what purpose, enhancing transparency and control. This mechanism strengthens public trust by making errors and potential misuse both visible and reportable. Each transaction within the X-Road ecosystem is timestamped, cryptographically signed, and logged to ensure integrity while preserving privacy—no log data is shared with the governing entity, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure while tampering of the logs is made impossible. Only metadata (header) is collected and published as open data, with query and response content remaining private between the parties. The open-source nature of X-Road further reinforces trust, allowing independent verification of its security and functionality. 03. Sustainable interoperability X-Road plays a vital role in promoting sustainability by allowing governments to optimize resource use and enable secure, efficient data exchange with energy-efficient infrastructure. By reducing the need for dedicated, resource-intensive private networks and leveraging existing public Internet infrastructure, X-Road minimizes redundancy and enhances resource utilization across multiple stakeholders. Cloud-based Security Servers (software components acting as access points to the X-Road ecosystem) can further improve X-Road’s sustainability by reducing energy consumption by up to 88 per cent compared to on-premises solutions, benefiting from efficient resource allocation and energy-efficient data centres. Since X-Road is a cloud-ready solution, organizations can seamlessly transition to cloud environments to enhance both environmental and operational efficiency. With a long-term vision of becoming the world’s most sustainable data exchange solution of its kind, X-Road aims to align with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support eco-friendly digital transformation. 04. The public sector digitalization landscape The adoption of X-Road has accelerated Estonia’s public sector digitalization efforts by providing a consistent framework that simplifies system integration and addresses complex technical challenges such as secure data exchange, encryption, and audit trails. By using X-Road as the primary integration channel, development teams can save significant time by reusing a proven solution for data exchange. X-Road also strengthens security, compliance, and resilience by providing a comprehensive framework that aligns with industry best practices, including Zero Trust principles and data integrity assurance. Furthermore, it fosters innovation by simplifying collaboration across software teams, allowing them to focus on impactful solutions while providing access to shared services and interoperable solutions that promote partnerships between government agencies and private sector stakeholders. 05. Data sovereignty X-Road ensures strong data sovereignty by employing a decentralized architecture that allows organizations to retain full control over their data and data access services. Every information system owner operates through a dedicated access point component—an X-Road Security Server—preserving sovereignty and enforcing strict access controls. Government entities maintain ownership of their data while defining who can access it and under what conditions, reinforcing security and autonomy. This approach also eliminates reliance on central intermediaries, as data is transferred directly between the data provider and the consumer. The end-to-end encryption mechanism guarantees that data remains confidential and accessible only to its intended recipient, enhancing security and trust. X-Road allows organizations to retain full control over their data exchange while ensuring compliance with both national and international data protection laws. Ultimately, this decentralized and secure model strengthens digital autonomy while fostering seamless and reliable data interoperability. 06. Cyber resilience X-Road enhances cyber resilience through a combination of proven security measures—such as encryption and digital signing—alongside decentralized architecture and continuous security evaluations. Over several decades, X-Road’s security framework has successfully withstood numerous widespread cyber-attacks in Estonia, demonstrating its reliability and robustness. By leveraging X-Road’s established security foundation, development teams can focus on their core objectives without the burden of building security measures from scratch. To ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats, commercial cybersecurity specialists regularly assess the X-Road software through comprehensive evaluations, including architecture reviews, threat modelling, and penetration testing. A public bug bounty program further enhances X-Road’s security by ensuring continuous improvement and resilience. 07. Digital Public Goods The Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) provides X-Road as an open-source solution to support global digital development and promote equal access to digital infrastructure. X-Road is vetted by the Digital Public Goods Alliance to ensure it fulfils the criteria of a Digital Public Good.

Our solution integrates appointment data, optimizes room allocations based on factors like doctor movement, and seamlessly syncs results with Outlook calendars, using HL7 FHIR standard interfaces. The solution can be integrated with patient information systems, facility services, and other background systems. Personnel resource allocation planning – the cornerstone of efficient service delivery In industries where service delivery requires professionals with a variety of different skills and qualifications, an unnecessary amount of time and effort is spent on planning. Processes can be fragmented, and manual, and rely on the specialized knowledge and expertise of individual people. We have co-developed with our customers a solution utilizing MS Power Platform and Azure platforms. The benefits of the solution lie in centralized data management, where everyone can see the information according to their user role needs. Shared information flows through the system from one stage of the process to the next, reducing manual work and errors combined with the usage of historical data used as a basis for plans and for developing operations. Process automation in an industrial environment A manufacturing client suffered from a very manual, and therefore slow and error-prone, purchase order processing system which required manual conversion and data en try to an ERP system. To speed up and automate the process we did a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Proof of Concept (PoC) project to evaluate the compatibility of Microsoft Power Automate with Oracle EBS and assess the feasibility and benefits of automating our customer’s order creation process. Product m arketing data m anagement solution One of our manufacturing customers had an outdated system that was burdensome to manage, with manual steps and slow adaptation to changes.

At Nortal, we help you identify where and how the ServiceNow platform can make the biggest impact on your organization through our envisioning and roadmap service.

What is the difference between ITOM and ITSM? While both are strategies for IT management, ITOM and ITSM are separate concepts. ITOM describes the individual processes and services that are administered by an IT department—this includes administrative processes, support for hardware and software, and services for internal and external clients. On the other hand, ITSM includes what a company does to manage IT services through the entirety of the life cycle, including strategic planning, service operation, service desk, continual service improvement, and design building. ITSM also encompasses the help desk and fulfilment of IT requests that come from employees. Best practices of ITSM are known as the ITIL framework, which describes the life cycle of service in detail. ITOM is covered under the ITIL framework. ITOM teams are meant to focus on daily tasks for the operation of an organization’s infrastructure components and applications—all aspects of the service operation stage defined in the ITSM lifecycle."

Atlassian tools enable teams to plan projects, transfer knowledge, and track tasks. The big advantage is that the products are highly scalable and therefore suitable for both small and large organizations. Atlassian tools can also be integrated with many third-party providers. Other reasons for choosing the Atlassian product range include time-saving automation, centralization of information, and high security standards. Why does Nortal partner with Atlassian? The partnership between Nortal and Atlassian brings together the best of both worlds: Atlassian's powerful products and Nortal's expertise in implementation, configuration, and integration. How long does it take to implement Atlassian software? The duration of implementation depends heavily on individual requirements. With cloud implementation, standard setups and smaller teams can get started within a few days, while complex projects with self-hosted solutions and strict security requirements can take several weeks to months. How does the integration of Atlassian tools with existing systems work? Atlassian tools can be integrated with existing systems via already-active interfaces and Marketplace apps. Tools such as Microsoft Teams offer connectors for Atlassian products, while Atlassian provides APIs. Plugins from the Atlassian Marketplace enable connections to customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, for example. What licensing models does Atlassian offer? Atlassian offers two main licensing models: Cloud and Data Center. While the Atlassian-hosted Cloud solution is more suitable for companies that want quick implementation and easy setup, the self-hosted Data Center option is ideal for organizations that require advanced security features and must adhere to strict compliance guidelines. What technical skills does our team need to manage Atlassian products? Basic IT skills and tool-specific knowledge are required to manage Atlassian products. Knowledge of workflow and process management as well as cloud hosting is an advantage, and basic knowledge of scripting languages can also be useful. At Nortal , we always aim to transfer knowledge and want to enable you to use Atlassian tools profitably. Are Atlassian tools GDPR compliant? Yes, Atlassian tools are GDPR compliant. Atlassian implements strict data protection and security measures, including data encryption, user control, and audit functions. For cloud users, data can be stored in GDPR-compliant data centers. These features are also available for most third-party Marketplace apps. Our Atlassian experts can help you review and configure your tools and apps for compliance. How can we measure the ROI of Atlassian software? There are several ways to measure the ROI of Atlassian software: You can analyze the time savings achieved through automation or compare operating costs with those before Atlassian products were introduced. Employee satisfaction, which is strongly influenced by workflows and team communication, can also be an indicator ."

Oman e-Census 2020 is a great example of how technology can accelerate public services. The award was received by Dr. Khalifa bin Abdullah al Barwani, the CEO of NCSI, during a ceremony held on 6 May 2024 under the auspices of HH Shaikh Meshaal al Ahmad al Jaber al Sabah, the Emir of the State of Kuwait. During the acceptance, Dr. Barwani spotlighted the efforts that the NCSI has made in recent years to digitally transform national statistics to support decision-making. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff during the previous population count in 2010. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Read the story in the Oman Observer A fully register-based census In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts.

    "title": "Data-driven solution for safer and smarter operations at Valmet",
    "content": "Case study May 5, 2025 Data-driven solution for safer and smarter operations at Valmet After a fire caused a data loss in a test facility, Valmet committed to ensuring that no valuable test data would be at risk again. Through a pioneering partnership with Nortal, Valmet merged Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) to create a customized, resilient, data-driven solution that prioritizes safety and efficiency. This project is part of a larger initiative under Valmet’s Factory IT program, a new strategic focus area designed to enable business excellence through modular capabilities and a scalable, extendable IT service offering for factory operations. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Data and AI Valmet, a leading global developer and supplier of process technologies, automation, and services for the pulp, paper, and energy industries, ensures quality by rigorously testing its products in a precise testing environment equipped with hundreds of condition monitoring sensors. Valmet’s test bench has significantly more product-specific sensors than those found on the customer’s factory floor, ensuring product quality. A few years ago, a fire broke out at the Valmet Rautpohja factory in Finland during a roll test, destroying one of the test rigs used for testing paper machine rolls (SymRoll). Fires during roll testing are extremely rare, but in such uncommon situations it is important to ensure that test data is recovered to a safe location and easily accessible. “Back then, we stored local data near the operator’s room, and we weren’t able to save all our test run data,” says Timo Ollila , Product Manager, Deflection compensated rolls, Board and Paper Mills Business Unit, Valmet. “With our old system, only data about the last test runs was available, and not easily accessible either.” Capturing crucial data from roll test runs The test environment is an accurate and data critical environment, where accurate data collection is non-negotiable. Every sensor measurement and video feed are vital to understanding performance and ensuring safety. It’s in this environment where data concerning sensors, roll inspection, startup recipes, and video needs to be collected, captured, and transmitted to the cloud. Because any data that isn’t in the cloud is at risk of not being able to be efficiently analyzed. Timo Ollila’s brief to Nortal had three requirements: Valmet needed to collect accurate data and keep it in a safe place. The data needed to be available, meaning visible, visualizable, and not complicated to get. Valmet wanted a suite of tools that would deliver tangible business value to Valmet and enable them to effectively leverage their data. Valmet’s pioneering solution in the heavy industry Nortal’s Cloud Architect Anssi Pannula and the rest of the team set to work to develop an IT/OT integration using the latest technologies. “Our solution collects data from the new test rig at the Rautpohja factory using 3,000 sensor tags that measure temperature, speed, pressure, flow and vibration, among many others” says Pannula, “and all of it is sent to Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric in near real time. Video is captured by four cameras, and all footage is stored in OneLake in Microsoft Fabric. With OneLake File Explorer, users can easily open and view videos directly through Windows File Explorer on their laptop.” If a similar accident were to occur in the future, Valmet could now quickly grasp the sequence of events and restore normal production more efficiently, eliminating the need for extensive time and manual efforts to identify the cause. \"We can now use data to identify any issues in roll testing and take preventative actions with the future in mind”, says Ollila. Along with enhanced safety, this solution also enables Valmet to collect and analyze large amounts of data in near real time. This capability supports the evaluation of various test rig configurations and the comparison of test runs, helping to identify the optimal settings and parameters for more efficient operations. Ollila says that the system provides machine operators with visual dashboards on Grafana, also developed by Nortal, alongside their trending tools. “If something happens during the test run, they can contact the roll engineers. Telemetry data supports fact-based decision-making by showing detailed insights, such as pressure and flow patterns. We can see what happens and if there are any broken components in the roll, which if detected early, can mean huge cost savings. We can do full testing without building separate measuring units. All of this is made possible by the comprehensive solution Nortal has delivered.” Nortal’s Business Area Director, Petri Rönkkö, says that Valmet’s modern cloud-based solution is not that common in the heavy industry. “Consumer-facing businesses are quickly adopting cloud technologies and ways of working, but in manufacturing, factories still do a lot of manual work in a siloed local on-premises environments, each with their own tools and systems. These kinds of solutions offer a comprehensive view of what’s happening on the shop floor. Unlocking the data is great on the factory floor, but it also supports top management needs when data siloes are broken down.” – Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland Valmet’s solution is designed with scalability in mind. The same platform capabilities can be re-used in other use cases as well to save money in the future and avoid point solutions for each separate use case. A collaborative approach to success What made it possible to achieve all this in six months from start to finish? Valmet says it’s because of how the team was structured and worked together. Teemu Vento, Global Operations, Factory IT Lead, Valmet, calls this an agile way of working in cohesive collaboration. “It was an MVP, so neither party knew exactly what we’d discover. For me, the best thing was the ability to make decisions along the way .” “There were three players in the team,” says Timo Ollila. “Valmet business, Valmet IT, and Nortal. That meant we had to have an open dialogue during the development process. Together we defined and clarified our needs, made compromises and constantly discussed between the three parties to make an optimal solution. I’m a mechanical engineer, not an IT specialist. I define our needs and Nortal and Valmet IT turned those into technical solutions fit for Valmet’s factory environment. The co-operation was smooth and the active dialogue between parties was the key to success in this project.” Data-driven s cal e With more than 19,000 employees and 60 production units worldwide, Valmet is excited about the opportunities to scale this Data Collection and Visualization Solution to be used in other Valmet factories and different use cases in future. “We have plans to scale this solution and realize the benefits of the solution in wider at Valmet”, says Vento. “So far, we’ve tested many rolls with the new rig and the process continues. Over the next year, we’ll see the real benefits, as the biggest savings will come from the new way of running the rolls. With a semi-automated process, reaction times are improved, and it’s quicker to conduct tests.”, Ollila says. Ollila believes that the key to a successful project is properly describing its scope in as much detail as possible — the more work done up front, the smoother everything goes. From Nortal’s side, it might be said that if there’s one skill beyond IT that we’ve keenly developed and put into practice over our 35 years in the business, it’s the ability to listen.

    "content": "Home Insights How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Case study October 16, 2024 How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Estonia is considered one of the most advanced digitized countries in the world. Not only are the citizens more open to new technologies, but the state has also made its point to always be ahead of the curve. The government proceedings have been paperless for almost 20 years and the parliament has used AI-supported transcriptions of its proceedings for over five years. Now it was time to speed up the legislative work of the parliament with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Service Data and AI Industry Government The parliament of Estonia, the Riigikogu, is the representative body of Estonia that among other things passes legislation like acts and resolutions and ratifies and denounces foreign treaties that impose military and proprietary obligations and bring about changes in law. Acts create the rules for different fields of life in Estonia upon which the functioning of the state is based. Working on acts with the lawyers of Riigikogu’s chancellery is therefore the most important and also the most time-consuming task of the Riigikogu. So, the chancellery of the Riigikogu needed a solution that would bring more efficacy to their legal department. Mountains of data The chancellery of the Riigikogu provides the conditions necessary for the parliament to perform its constitutional functions. While the proceeding of bills is the key task of the Riigikogu, the legal and research department advises all the 101 members of the Riigikogu, the board, the committees, the parliamentary groups and the employees working for them in order that the discussion in the parliament would be knowledge-based. The department replies to the information requests of the MPs, presents its opinions and analyses draft legislation, explanatory memoranda and other procedural documents proceeded by the Riigikogu. They also reply to information queries from the public. Thus far all the inquiries were addressed manually and one by one by the lawyers. With the vast amount of data generated and stored by the Riigikogu, traditional methods of document retrieval are time-consuming, laborious and prone to errors, and don’t provide a good user experience for fact checking. The solution needed to address these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) into a robust, user-friendly chatbot interface, streamlining access to information and enhancing decision-making processes. Intelligent search with legislative credibility We created a Nortal Tark based intelligent search solution MVP for the Chancellery of the Riigikogu that works in their internal web within the MS Azure infrastructure. Nortal Tark works through all the documents that lawyers used to search for answers manually before, e.g., the bill information system with all the legislative documents, including the European Union ones, previous official inquiries and answers, chancellery’s public documents etc. Tark translates the incoming question for the database inquiry, finds the answer, and presents it to the respective lawyer with references to the original documents. The lawyer can then use the presented information to, for example, formulate an answer to an inquiry or compile topic sheets for the MPs. Almost all the data involved with acts is public in Estonia and this first version of Riigikogu’s Nortal Tark implementation uses only public data . A country’s legislative body produces a lot of documents, even when the country is as forward-thinking and thin in bureaucracy as Estonia. So, the data that needed to be worked through for the implementation was colossal. The intelligent search application also takes into consideration the legislative credibility dimension. The aim is to pinpoint the most reliable source for inquiries, because what answers to the text search criteria, might not be the right answer from the lawyers’ perspective. For example, a simple search might come up with a document containing a similar question in it, but the lawyer needs an answer from a legislative document. Karl-Morten Koppel, Head of IT systems of the Parliament of Estonia \"This project has provided us with valuable insights into current AI models and their capabilities. It marks an important step in identifying how and where AI can be most effectively applied to maximize benefits, with the goal of improving both efficiency and the quality of services in the future, allowing citizens, MPs, and parliamentary staff to save time and work more productively.\" The main benefits of the intelligent search for Riigikogu Better user experience New, innovative solution Cost-effectiveness from timesaving Fast support One of the primary advantages of this intelligent search system is its ability to retrieve documents quickly and accurately, which makes answering inquiries faster. Users can interact with the chatbot using natural language queries, reducing the need for extensive manual searches or specific expertise. This significantly reduces the time spent digging up documents, allowing the chancellery staff to focus more on important matters. The intelligent search function for the chancellery of the Riigikogu is just the first step to test the waters of how the Riigikogu can benefit from genAI in the substantial work that they do. The next possible steps include making the application available to more people within the Riigikogu, moving it on-premises and adding internal data with corresponding access management to the system. The version with the public data could then be expanded to public use for the queries they might have for the Riigikogu.

    "content": "Home Insights Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Case study September 2, 2024 Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Nortal introduces an API-based solution to enable more efficient energy management to support Outokumpu’s ambitious sustainability goals. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Outokumpu is the global leader in sustainable stainless steel. Stainless steel operations are energy intensive, so Outokumpu uses the best available technology, electric arc furnaces, and continuously strives to make its production operations more energy efficient. In fact, Outokumpu’s biggest plant, located in Tornio, Finland, is the biggest single energy user in the Nordics. In general, to produce a ton of stainless steel in an electric arc furnace requires about 440 kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough to power hundreds of homes for an entire month. This is to say that when a company like Outokumpu turns its attention to saving energy, it is more than just a gesture—it is of global significance. By the end of 2024, the company’s goal is to improve energy efficiency by eight percent compared to a similar period two years prior. This will equate to an energy saving of around 600,000 megawatt hours, enough to power 15,000 households. Part of what makes this possible is Nortal helping Outokumpu feed the right data to their energy management system (EMS). Harnessing the power of data The problem is that data systems are many and diverse, with various downstream locations for data needed in the EMS. Data from manufacturing execution systems and other factory floor systems, such as maintenance breaks and production planning are needed for efficient energy management. Nortal created an API that combines the data sources and channels in to the EMS in close to real-time. Harnessing multiple sources of data, creating a harmonized API layer, and doing it fast, means that the savings can be staggering for a company that purchases energy on the spot market. “Outokumpu’s sustainability strategy aims at decarbonization and supporting customers to reduce their supply chain emissions,” says Harri Salo , Outokumpu’s Manager – Energy, Electrical and Crane Services. “Integration of the energy management system greatly supports this strategy. It enables us to measure electricity consumption, providing data that enables the possibility to adjust and optimize electricity usage. Additionally, this capability improves the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts and allows us to enhance our cost efficiency in production.” Beyond cost savings Energy and cost savings are of course important, but Outokumpu has even bigger aspirations. “Yes, EMS is a major scalable solution, which will save energy,” says Junhui Wang , Outokumpu’s Head of Data Platforms & Integrations. “But it’s much more than that. The EMS leverages our API strategy. It’s one of the enablers of our sustainability strategy, the cornerstone in our API strategy and governance.” What this means is that the solution is scalable and can be taken beyond the Tornio plant. It also supports the production of Outokumpu’s spearhead climate solution, Outokumpu Circle Green®, a product line with up to 93 percent lower carbon footprint compared to the global industry average*. Outokumpu calculates that if all stainless steel was produced in the same way, then global carbon emissions from the entire stainless steel value chain could be reduced by 364 million tons per year, or roughly 900 million one-way flights of a passenger from London to New York. “Outokumpu’s aim is to remain as the global leader in sustainable stainless steel,” says Harri Salo. “And we’re committed to keep the global warming at 1.5 ºC according to the Science-Based Targets Initiative”. *) Global average CO₂ emissions (2023): 7 kg CO₂e per kg of stainless steel (Outokumpu’s calculation based on data provided by CRU, worldstainless and Kobolde & Partners AB). Outokumpu Circle Green CO₂ emissions: down to 0.5 kilos of CO₂e per kg of stainless steel. Strategic partnership Helping to pave the way for advances in the steel industry digitalization is Nortal, who has worked in the metals sector for almost 40 years, much of that time with Outokumpu. “EMS is an excellent example of a solution that drives our customer’s high-level enterprise architecture and integration strategy forward while introducing clear business benefits”, says Jarkko Enden , CTO of Nortal Finland. “Long strategic partnerships, such as the one we have with Outokumpu, are a unique trait of Nortal Finland that we’re especially proud of.” – Junhui Wang, Head of Data Platforms & Integrations, Outokumpu Nortal has been a pivotal partner for Outokumpu, providing significant support in implementing our integration and API strategy over the past years. Our integration landscape, characterized by a diverse array of technologies and tools, has been complex. With Nortal's expertise, we are now on the right path towards achieving our North Star Integration Architecture.

    "content": "Home Insights Battling pandemics with the help of AI Case study October 9, 2024 Battling pandemics with the help of AI In a national health crisis, the population’s need for fast, professional, and trustworthy advice skyrockets. Even with seasonal illnesses, the increase in inquiries is sudden, burdening the phone lines of health offices. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) needed a futureproof solution to make communication with the citizens more efficient. Enter Artificial Intelligence. Service Data and AI Industry Healthcare Lower Saxony has a population of eight million, making it the fourth largest state in population among Germany’s 16 states. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) is the state’s central authority for communicable and non-communicable diseases and health risks. The NGLA aims to promote and protect the health of the people of Lower Saxony. 1 week, 1000 phone calls When COVID-19 hit Germany, the Lower Saxony state health office’s phone lines were overflooded with people hungry for information about this fast-spreading new disease. The health office received well over 1000 telephone inquiries a week. The delegation of calls via a switchboard could not be handled due to the overload, both in terms of personnel and infrastructure. However, the majority of the calls had identical questions that could have been answered using standardized templates. Given that the last four pandemics occurred almost every 15 years on average, and some believe that pandemics have been happening more often in recent decades, the NLGA needed a solution that would be futureproof not overcrowding their phone lines again, but still giving people the information and peace of mind that they needed. Efficacy through the secure use of AI We developed an AI-based chat and voice bot for the Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) built on our AI solution Nortal Tark . With the help of the intelligent assistant named Nova , citizens can ask NLGA questions around the clock while relieving the health department’s employees of some of the work burden. Users can call up the chatbot on the NLGA website , ask their questions, and receive an answer within seconds, for example, on specific diseases such as COVID-19 or measles or even recommendations on what to do in the case of head lice. This turnkey solution has the secure use of AI at its core – on a secure database that the NLGA controls 100 percent. Nova collects information from several knowledge sources, which the NLGA previously views, checks, and selects. The database is, therefore, professionally curated, can be constantly expanded by NLGA, and protected against data misuse. The intelligent assistant quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content, making communication with the citizens futureproof. It answers standard questions in various languages ​​and in the NLGA’s tone. Dr. Fabian Feil, President of the NLGA \"We are proud to be the first authority in Lower Saxony to launch an AI-supported chatbot, thus significantly improving communication with citizens even in the event of a crisis. A big thank you goes to our colleagues at Nortal, who were able to accurately identify our needs and, together with our team, in a very short time created a more than competitive solution using new technology.\" 24-hour service with minimal burden The project makes the NLGA a digital pioneer in the public sector. It exemplifies how generative AI and large language models (LLMs) can be used in administrative authorities. Employees’ time answering simple inquiries is reduced, which is particularly helpful in crises during epidemics or seasonal illnesses. The more efficient processing of queries leaves them more time to focus on more complex tasks and inquiries. The benefits of implementing Nova Good user experience Users can easily access the chatbot on the NLGA website, benefitting from a 24-hour chat service without language barriers. Futureproof With the help of generative AI and LLMs, the chatbot quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content.

    "title": "AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel",
    "content": "Home Insights AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Case study June 25, 2024 AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Artificial intelligence is much talked about, but solutions running in production are rare. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest stainless steel producer, turned to Nortal, its trusted partner for decades, to create a business-critical AI solution that is set to be scaled globally. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources While steel has been manufactured for a thousand years, stainless steel wasn’t created until the early 1900s. And given its complex chemical post-processing procedure, engineers and scientists have never stopped trying to perfect it. Challenge Surface defects cannot be avoided even in the most sophisticated production facilities. However, by detecting these defects early in the process, it is possible to better ensure that the customer gets the right quality required for their needs. Whenever a stainless steel surface is on display, such as on a building’s façade, it must be flawless. A car part hidden from view, however, can tolerate some defects. The key is to make sure the quality produced matches the end user’s needs, ensuring both a happy customer and a profitable business. There is a significant business advantage for manufacturers able to identify surface issues as far upstream as possible, allowing preventive action, reduced cost of reprocessing, and right-quality products routed to customers. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest producer of stainless steel, turned to Nortal to develop an advanced surface inspection system (ASIS) that could be scaled globally to other Outokumpu sites. Nortal is Outokumpu’s partner for its Global Data Platform, enabling seamless collaboration in the scaling processes. Solution Understanding defects and root causes like never before “A defect in hot rolling can extend further down to cold rolling, and a scratch can elongate to several meters,” explains Maximilian Hartmann , ASIS project manager from Outokumpu. “Understanding how defects occur helps us improve processes and take action early enough so we’re not doing unnecessary rework.” Beginning in October 2024, Outokumpu’s Tornio plant will switch to an altogether new version of an ASIS system which uses AI and Machine Learning to identify defects. “Human inspectors can’t evaluate a coil to the same degree of detail and consistency that a machine learning system can,” says Hartmann. “The renewed ASIS system supports inspectors in evaluating the full coil beyond what bare human eye can detect.” Constructing the new version of ASIS system was especially complicated, since building from scratch was not an option. First, a proof-of-concept ASIS system built by a previous vendor needed to be stabilized. The team utilized as much of the existing solution as possible but were required to re-engineer the application’s hybrid cloud architecture from scratch in order to meet the high availability requirements for the application. As a production-critical solution, ASIS must run even in scenarios when the internet is down, adding to the complexity of the required technology architecture. Nortal’s Senior Data Scientist, Erkki Alamäe, greatly enhanced the AI-based defect detection model, enabling the team to integrate it more tightly into the solution and significantly raise the level of automation in the defect detection process. Result Nortal’s solution unlocks massive benefits “Surface quality is one of the most important parameters of stainless steel production. The new version of the ASIS is a system we can scale globally and use the Machine Learning model to help the operators’ work in production without relying solely on manual labor to ensure right quality for every customer,” says Hartmann. The benefits are many. Customers get the quality they require, production planning and flow are optimized, and coils with problems are repaired or rerouted. Defects identified earlier mean lower costs, plus long-term benefits thanks to the identification of root causes. It’s a multisite solution that will allow quality information for coils to be transferred between various Outokumpu sites in Europe. Additionally, there are significant savings in storage costs, rejected materials, and through fewer customer claims. – Maximilian Hartmann, ASIS Project Manager Outokumpu I’m really happy how the development has gone with Nortal. We always moved constructively in the right direction. The way of working is clean, well-organized, and people talk openly.

    "content": "Home Insights Data architecture unlocking new business opportunities for one of Finland’s largest food services company Case study April 3, 2024 Data architecture unlocking new business opportunities for one of Finland’s largest food services company Compass Group Finland partnered with Nortal to build a data platform enabling growth and increased operational efficiency. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Consumer Enterprise Compass Group Finland is one of Finland’s most prominent food service companies, serving clients with €230 million in annual revenue. Their primary business is providing B2B food and multi-services to all sectors in Finland and serve thousands of Finns from kids in nurseries to students in lower and higher education and from working people in lunch restaurants to seniors across the country. They partnered with Nortal to build data architecture that would allow them to gather mission-critical business insights and make data-driven decisions to further drive growth and operational efficiency. The result was a data platform that saved on costs and enabled faster innovation, allowing Compass Group to focus on tackling its mission – critical challenges while increasing competitive advantage in a perpetually growing market. Challenge A fragmented data landscape slows down the speed of innovation, creating bottlenecks that slow development. In late 2019, Compass Group reached out to Nortal to build an integration from their previous reporting system to their new CRM. The goal was to successfully transfer data and eventually eliminate the old reporting system entirely. After this project’s successful completion, Compass Group wanted to figure out how they could use this data to better solve their most mission-critical business challenges. The challenge was a scattered data landscape with no centralized system or workflows that would allow for easy data retrieval. As with most other large service companies, Compass Group has hundreds of stakeholders and organizations within its orbit. All of them have their own data in fragmented places. There is no way to centralize this information to get a cohesive understanding of what’s going on and , therefore , make the right business decisions – fast. This slows the speed of innovation and creates unnecessary bottlenecks hindering development. Solution A centralized data platform hosting Compass Group Finland’s data and intelligence. As a solution, we built a data platform that functioned as the central ecosystem of Compass Group Finland’s data and intelligence. It hosted all domains – from customer to financial, HR, sales, and procurement data – while allowing incoming data flow from various source systems. The platform enables all modeling and publishing to happen directly within this same system, with system-specific data being turned into easily understood concepts. The data platform and all related services were built on Azure. Moving it away from physical data centers to a cloud environment simplified the architecture significantly and helped save on costs. – Pekka Hytönen, Senior Manager, D&T Transformation and IT Operations, Compass Group Finland Oy Ongoing support from Nortal has been excellent, and we have been able to add new data sources and integrations to our solution easily. Impact Quick data-driven decision – making allows for faster innovation and positive environmental impacts. The impact of this data architecture project has been felt across many areas of the business. The elimination of Compass Group’s old reporting system and the transfer of data from centers into the cloud slashed costs significantly. With the centralized data platform, Compass Group can now retrieve information to make data-driven business decisions in record time. Rather than spending months piecing together different data sets to get an answer to a question, Compass Group can now turn to the platform for near-immediate results. Compass Group can allocate resources, manage waste, and fine-tune food orders much more efficiently w ith precise, up-to-date data. Customers also benefit from the additional insight, with the company being able to list ingredient and sourcing details on menus. This newfound visibility also has an environmental impact. With more visibility into supply chains, the company has a better understanding of where raw materials come. This enables them to make strategic interventions and more eco-conscious choices where possible. A solid technical foundation enables the leadership team to tackle business needs quickly and with agility – ensuring they can stay ahead of the competition with a high rate of innovation. – Pekka Hytönen, Senior Manager, D&T Transformation and IT Operations, Compass Group Finland Oy Looking backward, a couple of years after the solution was deployed, we can say that it has proven to be robust, reliable, scalable, and flexible to adjust to our needs.

    "title": "Nortal creates high-volume event streaming for large telecommunications and wireless company",
    "content": "Case study March 14, 2023 by Newel Rice, Sr. Solutions Architect Nortal creates high-volume event streaming for large telecommunications and wireless company Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise Telecommunication and Media With Nortal’s help, one of the largest telecommunications and wireless companies in the world accomplished near real-time solutions utilizing Snowflake’s Data Cloud. In doing so, Nortal made our client’s struggling architecture come to life and empowered other business users with the proper data they needed when they needed it the most. Getting to data faster has never been more in demand within the telecommunication space. With the pace of their industry set on eleven, our client needed to find a way to get out from under a failing architecture for high-volume event streaming application data. The Digital side of the company has made great strides in creating detailed event streaming data from the applications they are building. However, the ability to receive, process, and make that data available to the business has proven to be a significant challenge for this Fortune 500 company. Lost and slow moving data combined with the soaring costs were sending the business into a tailspin and they needed to find a way out of this problem and fast. Challenge The legacy architecture our client was struggling with is an amalgamation of in-house solutions that uses a batch processing pipeline built on top of AWS services, including: Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) Simple Storage Service (S3) Apache Spark on Amazon EMR clusters After numerous failures of this architecture at key points in their business, the large telecom company knew they were in trouble and turned to Nortal to assist with the challenges they were facing. Nortal’s long-time partnership and proven experience in this domain was the obvious choice in helping achieve the following goals: Demonstrating the future state solution will be able to handle a sustained maximum historical peak load the company has seen so far in production Benchmark the results proving future state architecture and giving a reference to where they started with the new architecture Reduced complexity in the architecture Reduce the labor-intensive aspects and requirements of the current state architecture Optimize costs of operating the event streaming near real-time data pipelines Minimally disrupt the in-place services, taking advantage of the streaming event driven/event bus architecture Get data in the hands of the business users faster (ideally within an hour of an event being received) With their sights on these goals, Nortal, our partner Snowflake, and in collaboration with an in-house technical team, set about to create the new architecture in a matter of weeks to address these goals. Nortal’s approach With Nortal’s deep knowledge in Snowflake’s Data Cloud technologies, the team decided to take advantage of the existing investment that the customer has previously made into these technologies. Our main goal was to apply the Snowflake Connector for Kafka to the project to increase results from the previous architecture. Capitalizing on the pre-existing managed platform, we were able to enhance the platform for containerized workloads and services. Results The solution proved that it is more than capable of handling a sustained peak workload. In fact, the solution can handle 2x peak workload and with a delayed start of the solution with a demonstrated ability to overcome the message backlog By creating a benchmarking harness and documenting results, our client can turn to these tools and information when making changes to the solution. The complexity of the solution has been vastly reduced in using commercially available and supported tooling. Tooling that comes with its own documentation and support reducing the burned on internal technical team The solution is configurable not only for connectivity but also for scalability with automation that has been built to virtually eliminate most of the labor-intensive aspects and requirements of the legacy architecture The cost of the near real-time solution operating at full scale is less than the incumbent batch solution and furthermore, is scalable to meet the needs of the demand permitting even more economy in operation The solution in no way impedes the legacy solution. The new solution operates alongside the legacy solution taking advantage of the MSK architecture permitting a full cutover to the new architecture and decommissioning of the legacy solution at the convenience of our client The new architecture has shown to deliver event streaming data ready and consumable by the business users within as little as 7 seconds and at most in about 60 seconds The new architecture is flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of other and similar workloads The new architecture integrates with our client’s security and brings data to a platform that has broad reaching capabilities and a rich set of business data giving the business user the ability to combine this data in new ways to tease out new insights and opportunities The body of work was accomplished ahead of schedule in a short 5 week timeframe Impact The demands for the business to have access to data within near real-time is becoming, if not already being, the standard expectation of the telecom industry. This need is relentless and unyielding for companies like our client to stay competitive now and in the future. We are proud to have transformed a cripplingly slow and costly batch based process that was failing to meet the company’s needs, to a fast, nimble, scalable and cost-effective architecture. It was abundantly clear to this tech giant that they needed help of Nortal to create an architecture that wasn’t a back-breaking venture fraught with inadequacies and delays, but rather a transparent, flexible, and capable business tool that gets them the data when they need it most. In this new solution, our client now has the capability and the confidence to move forward translating insights into opportunities at near real-time speed for less cost than their legacy batch-based architecture could ever provide.

    "title": "Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence",
    "content": "Home Insights Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Case study October 29, 2022 Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Service Data and AI Industry Government Being unemployed is not only difficult for a citizen but also costly for the government, especially if it lasts more than six months. The longer a person is without a job, the harder it is for them to find the next one. And for the state, it negatively affects GDP – more money is spent on unemployment benefits and workforce retraining, and more time is spent on counseling. In 2020, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund decided that AI adoption in the public sector would help to tackle long-term unemployment and help people get back to work faster. Challenge Missing the bigger picture The trouble with the current process of understanding and counseling clients with job loss is the considerable number of resources required to work through extensive background information of all the customers and get a complete overview of the caseloads. Profiling data per one unemployed person comprises 45 separate indicators, from socio-demographics, prior employment history, labor market characteristics, and up-to-date health data and job vacancies. The abundance of data makes it laborious and error-prone to distinguish the unemployed who have more difficulties getting back into the labor market and should receive more attention and resources. In addition, the state is missing an overview of whether the implemented measures and current labor market policies are relevant and cost-effective. Solution Reducing the harmful effects of unemployment To keep unemployment time as short as possible, raise the quality of the services provided to the unemployed, and increase the efficiency of organizational processes, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) partnered with Nortal. In collaboration with the Center for IT Impact Studies (CITIS) and Resta, Nortal developed an AI-powered decision-support tool (OTT) that predicts the risk of long-term unemployment. The OTT tool helps EUIF counselors better understand their customers’ situations by calculating the probability of getting a new job and the level of risk of becoming unemployed again. Moreover, OTT provides counselors with information which factors impact the risk score most and unveil the possible reasons for unemployment. The decision-support tool collects data from many public registries connected via X-Road and analyses information over the last five years, including salaries from the Tax Office, education from the Board of Education, and subsidies from the Social Welfare Office. As a result, with the help of OTT, counselors can distinguish low-risk applicants from high-risk ones. The first group is most likely able to find the next job independently, but the second needs detailed assistance. OTT allows counselors to focus on jobseekers with the highest risk of prolonged unemployment. In addition, the tool provides EUIF with a more profound understanding of the labor market’s condition and helps to develop data-based labor. 3,8% of Estonia’s yearly expenditures were saved by reducing unemployment by a single day 95% forecast accuracy 100% visibility of the unemployed, risks, and regional trends daily Impact Planning labor policies with real-time data With the help of Machine Learning, the Estonian government has a management tool for implementing and planning policy measures with a real-time prediction of long-term unemployment risks and automated suggestions of the best ways to prevent them. — The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) The solution is an AI-powered decision support tool, which supplements the official data from multiple government registries and the extensive experience of the counselors in helping people get back into the labor market. Result Helping people get back to work faster In 2021, the AI-powered decision support tool OTT was awarded The Best Data-Based Digital Service in the Estonian public sector. EUIF counselors are utilizing this solution daily, with positive results. The decision-support tool shows the counselors where to put their effort and priorities, helping them make better decisions when allocating resources to those who need them the most. Further, the practical experience of using AI has opened new possibilities for how the calculations resulting from automated impact assessment solutions can be applied – for example, providing evidence-based information on how benefits and subsidies affect the movement to work and if the current measures are relevant and cost-effective. As a positive side-effect of these types of solutions, the state will have a real-time overview of the current unemployment status on an individual, regional, and state-wide level, helping understand the labor market’s ongoing processes better and take a proactive role in developing effective labor policies.

    "content": "Home Insights Transforming data into operational business success Article December 18, 2024 Transforming data into operational business success Three real-life case examples reveal how data-driven decisions and innovativeness can be realized in the complex operational environment of any industry. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources As an operational leader, you’re no stranger to the complications of data management. When the supply chain is scattered, and particularly if your business is a puzzle of merged organizations and acquired entities, your operational teams must wrestle with countless data sources, formats, and systems, from ERP and CRM to accounting, inventory, and project management. Each system operates with its unique data model, structure, and quality. This makes it tedious to create a unified view over your operations – let alone across the organization or the entire supply chain. In this article, we will share some best practices and real-life examples of Nortal’s customers who are leaders in their industries. Despite their different business environments, all these customers have realized that moving from an experience-based to a data-driven approach will enable a step change in the efficiency and innovativeness of daily operations. The value of data platforms in running the daily operations Data integration combines data from different sources and systems into a unified and consistent format to easily access, analyze, and share. Data integration and a functioning data platform can help your daily operations achieve four key benefits: Know what’s going on: By eliminating data silos, duplicates, and inconsistencies, you know what is happening and what comes next in the field and operations across the value chain. Share relevant data: By creating a single source of truth of your data, you can enable your teams and external stakeholders, such as partners or regulators, to access and use the operational data they need. Reduce costs: With a data layer that can be flexibly modified, there is less pressure to change the often rigid and old operational systems, thereby saving costs. Increase innovation: By connecting and enriching your data, you can uncover new patterns, trends, and opportunities in your operations, leading to unforeseen business innovations and faster development of new offerings. Utilizing advanced technologies like Artificial intelligence also only becomes possible when your data is consistent and unified. Compass Group took charge of operational restaurant data Compass Group is the world’s leading food and multi-service company, bringing joy and refreshment to the days of schoolchildren, workers, seniors, and event-goers through its hundreds of restaurants. Compass Group Finland’s data-driven journey began from a scattered data landscape, where data generated through countless acquisitions and spread across different repositories made it challenging to get to the quick, facts-based decisions needed in today’s fast-paced market. The demand for operational data was multi-faceted: finance produced masses of information, but it did not speak the language of the businesses. The tool for planning the daily menus in the restaurants offered no transparency on whether the plans were followed, which caused inefficiencies in production forecasting and supply chains. The sustainability function, in turn, needed data to respond to regulatory needs and to support the green transformation. Together with the customer, Nortal has identified more than ten business functions where the need for better use of data is imminent. With Compass Group, the work started by modeling the data and naming entities according to the language used in the business and operations. We then created a centralized data platform that brought all of Compass Group’s data under one roof. Every piece of data on this platform, from customer information to financials and HR, was neatly organized and easily accessible. By moving to a cloud environment, we not only simplified the architecture but also helped Compass Group cut down on costs. The new data platform allows Compass Group to make swift, informed decisions on all levels, from operations to top management. Resource allocation, waste management, and materials ordering have become more efficient, positively impacting the company’s bottom line and environmental burden. Customers also enjoy a more transparent dining experience, with detailed ingredients and sourcing information at their fingertips. Data has also found entirely new and unforeseen use cases. The data modeling done in the restaurants’ menu planning yielded unexpected benefits when Compass Group’s suppliers started requesting product demand forecasts. The readily gathered and modeled data made it easy to build and share the needed estimates with the suppliers in real-time. Energy group St1 drives business sustainability and scalability with effective data handling Nortal’s collaboration with St1 , an energy group committed to renewable fuels, has produced a data platform solution that ensures compliance with the EU’s stringent sustainability criteria for biomass used in energy production. We have also developed digital solutions to manage and enable transparency across St1’s value chain. The solutions provide visibility into the inventory of biofuel raw materials, allowing the optimization of sourcing, processing, and distribution. These capabilities, for their part, ensure the scalability of St1’s business operations. One of St1’s latest investments, the Gothenburg biorefinery, is an example of the value of the newly built solutions. In Gothenburg, various raw materials will be utilized to produce renewable diesel, jet fuel, and bionaphtha. The novel tools help effectively oversee the refinery’s entire value chain of renewable fuels, sustainability criteria, and the plant’s physical mass balance. Outokumpu transforms into a data-driven enterprise for agility and innovation Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, started moving forward with digital manufacturing in 2019. The aim was to fully digitalize its largest factory in Tornio, Finland, transforming it into the industry’s most digital and cost-efficient stainless-steel operation. As other Outokumpu sites were to follow Tornio’s example, the company needed a comprehensive, modern, industrial digital platform to support its ambition . An enterprise-grade technology platform transforms an organization into a data-driven powerhouse, equipping it to excel in a rapidly changing business environment by enhancing strategic decision-making and operational efficiency and fostering continuous innovation. Traditionally, separating business intelligence (BI) and analytics from applications, APIs, and integrations has led to fragmented data models, communication issues, and silos that hinder organizational cohesion. A composable enterprise approach aligned with data product principles and team structures breaks down these silos, enabling unified data flow and cohesive insights. Outokumpu, for instance, exemplifies this with its platform engineering strategy, leveraging hybrid-cloud data, integration, and API platforms managed by collaborative teams, including Nortal’s development teams. This approach not only ensures seamless integration and better data accessibility but also drives continuous improvement, unlocking value for the core business. Data-driven operations start today Forward-thinking companies like Compass Group, Outokumpu, and St1 have demonstrated the immense benefits of adopting a data-driven approach. For operational businesses across industries, where data capabilities are often inherited from several mergers and acquisitions and supply chains are scarce, a data platform frequently proves to bear unforeseeable value. Becoming data-driven can provide a quick fix to that thorn in your side that slows your daily operations, provide the long-needed transparency to the supply chain, or enable entirely new, unpredictable innovations that would not have occurred to anybody without the latest insights. Ultimately, something starting from a small trial can be transformative for your business. Going forward, the ability to effectively harness and utilize data will be a defining factor in the efficiency and innovativeness of daily operations, and industry leaders are already embracing this change.

Tailored solutions for your unique needs More efficient space utilization - achieving savings on fixed costs by increasing utilization rates and consolidating An organization needs premises in order to provide physical service delivery. With current practices, the utilization rates of office spaces often remain significantly low which creates costs in terms of excess space capacity and insufficient service production. Space resource management helps in reserving the right space for service delivery and the smooth functioning of a professional's work, as well as in organizing space reservations into a cohesive whole. Our solution integrates appointment data, optimizes room allocations based on factors like doctor movement, and seamlessly syncs results with Outlook calendars, using HL7 FHIR standard interfaces. The solution can be integrated with patient information systems, facility services, and other background systems. Personnel resource allocation planning – the cornerstone of efficient service delivery In industries where service delivery requires professionals with a variety of different skills and qualifications, an unnecessary amount of time and effort is spent on planning. Processes can be fragmented, and manual, and rely on the specialized knowledge and expertise of individual people. We have co-developed with our customers a solution utilizing MS Power Platform and Azure platforms. The benefits of the solution lie in centralized data management, where everyone can see the information according to their user role needs. Shared information flows through the system from one stage of the process to the next, reducing manual work and errors combined with the usage of historical data used as a basis for plans and for developing operations. Process automation in an industrial environment A manufacturing client suffered from a very manual, and therefore slow and error-prone, purchase order processing system which required manual conversion and data en try to an ERP system. To speed up and automate the process we did a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Proof of Concept (PoC) project to evaluate the compatibility of Microsoft Power Automate with Oracle EBS and assess the feasibility and benefits of automating our customer’s order creation process. Product m arketing data m anagement solution One of our manufacturing customers had an outdated system that was burdensome to manage, with manual steps and slow adaptation to changes. We assisted in scoping, defining, and planning the replacement of this original solution, which was built on Mendix, with the goal of improving usability and reducing costs. We developed a Product Marketing Data Management solution to enrich and maintain product marketing data, including texts and typical product properties displayed on their website in an online material selection tool for end customers. The latest version, released in March 2024, was built on the Power Platform using Canvas App and Dataverse. A future-focused sales and customer service concept and tools for building deeper customer relationships Significant challenges can arise from a fragmented tool landscape and scattered customer-related data, leading to limited visibility into customer interactions. This disconnection complicates the management of these interactions and hinders the generation of accurate sales forecasts. Without a centralized system, leveraging customer insights becomes difficult, impeding effective customer management and strategic decision-making. Using Microsoft Power Platform, Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, we designed and implemented a modern, cloud-based CRM solution tailored to our customer's needs. This solution enabled a centralized view of all customer interactions, streamlined the sales and service processes, and provided a solid foundation for advanced customer management and sales forecasting capabilities.

Embracing them is a necessary part of growth and success. However, there are ways to avoid pitfalls that come with GenAI. Jump to the 7-step guide Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise GenAI tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and their derivative systems, such as virtual assistants or chatbots, are increasingly being adopted by organizations across both private and public sectors. These systems can solve many mundane routine tasks, streamline operations, and enhance productivity. The technology behind LLMs has become widely available through open-source software, making it accessible to a broader audience. Resources such as the Hugging Face repository facilitate the sharing and deployment of LLMs, enabling users to integrate these advanced systems into their workflows promptly. The availability of open-source LLMs, coupled with their competitive quality compared to proprietary models, makes them an attractive option for various applications. According to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report , 149 LLMs were released in 2023 alone, and 98 are open source. In addition to large open-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, smaller models can be conveniently run locally on a laptop or on-premises to fulfill smaller specialized tasks. However, this being a relatively new and maverick technology pushing our comfort levels in both ways, novel risks also come with it , from model theft to bias. To provide guidelines for identifying and evaluating these risks, there are numerous risk assessment frameworks and published analyses, such as the OWASP , NIST AI risk management framework and the European Commission’s AI Act . Article 10 things to watch out for with open source gen AI A multi-faceted approach to risk management The risks fall roughly into three categories – infrastructure, user, and model-related. While addressing the infrastructure risks following software development best practices and risks related to users can be managed by educating employees, the threats related to models themselves (and how users communicate with them) are more challenging to catch and mitigate. These risks pertain to the LLMs themselves, including issues related to their reliability and ethical use. Open-source models may lack the rigorous testing and validation processes that proprietary models undergo, potentially increasing the likelihood of errors or biases in their outputs. They can also risk providing low-quality or factually incorrect answers, disclosing sensitive information, and possessing an excessive agency, i.e., too much autonomy in communicating with other parts of the larger system without human oversight. One of the best ways to manage the risks associated with the models is to implement AI guardrails . AI guardrails are predefined rules, filters, and mechanisms around the model guiding the AI’s behavior, ensuring they operate within legal boundaries in an expected, acceptable, and safe way. They help to prevent unintended consequences, such as biased, erroneous, or toxic outputs, privacy violations, and security breaches. For open-source LLMs, AI guardrails can be implemented at various stages of the model lifecycle, from data collection and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. However, most enterprises use “off the shelf” models rather than training models themselves, making it challenging to control the quality and nature of the training data. Nevertheless, they can test the model with various inputs and evaluate outputs. Jump to the 7-step guide 7 steps to a more responsible GenAI Identifying the risks is only the first step. Here’s how to effectively address AI-related risks to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs. 1. Maintain infrastructure hygiene Risks like DoS attacks and unauthorized access to the model (i.e., model theft) come from the underlying infrastructure where LLMs are deployed. As cloud-based services dominate LLM-based systems implementation, cloud service providers such as Microsoft Azure, GCP, and AWS typically implement robust security measures to protect the underlying infrastructure themselves. This includes regular software updates, patch management, and network security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. They also deploy strategies to safeguard against DoS attacks, which can disrupt the availability of LLMs. This can involve firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic monitoring to identify and block malicious activities. While securing the infrastructure may seem primarily out of your hands, organizations using LLMs must still actively secure their deployments by managing access, configuring networks, and protecting sensitive data through encryption and monitoring. 2. Invest in AI-literacy The aphorism “human error” wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t a reality. There certainly are risks associated with how users interact with LLMs. For instance, users might attempt to alter model instructions via prompt jailbreaking or submit insulting content such as “you are the worst AI ever,” trying to engage the model in unwanted behavior. Overreliance on the model-generated answers without critical assessment and further propagating this potentially biased or harmful content is another example of user-associated risk. AI literacy is essential to mitigate user-associated risks by helping users understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as their inability to comprehend context like humans or their tendency to produce biased or inaccurate outputs. Educating users to evaluate responses critically and use AI to complement human expertise reduces overreliance and the spread of misinformation. Clear guidelines and policies for respectful and ethical usage, including avoiding unauthorized GenAI tools for business purposes and harmful interactions, further ensure responsible engagement. Organizations can also provide resources and training to promote informed and effective use of AI systems. 3. Moderate prompt inputs Moderating user prompt inputs is a crucial step in AI guardrails, ensuring the secure and effective operation of LLMs, as it addresses risks such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and engagement in harmful or undesirable behaviors. By implementing robust input scanning and moderation, organizations can safeguard against manipulation attempts, protect user privacy, and ensure the model produces accurate and appropriate outputs. The following measures can help achieve these goals: Remove hidden text containing non-printable, invisible Unicode characters from text inputs that can contain hidden instructions to manipulate model behaviors. Clearly divide model instructions and user input in the system prompt to avoid prompt jailbreaks. Provide user input separated by some identifier, e.g., triple quotes. Filter out toxic inputs attempting to engage the model in harmful behavior. Detect and exclude personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent identity leaks or misuse up to identity theft. Restrict prohibited input types, such as code snippets or hyperlinks. Avoid undesired topics like religion, violence, or harassment using tools like OpenAI’s Moderator API. Clean user inputs. Remove any special characters or sequences that could interfere with the prompt. 4. Limit access and excessive agency Excessive agency in LLMs refers to the risk of AI systems taking action or influencing decisions beyond their intended scope, potentially causing security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, or unintended outcomes. One critical aspect of addressing the risk of excessive agency in AI models is to limit their access and capabilities. LLMs may perform unintended and unexpected actions when connected or integrated to other systems. By restricting the model’s access to sensitive information and keeping it separate from critical systems, organizations can prevent the AI from acting with too much autonomy. This involves carefully defining the scope of the AI’s tasks and ensuring it does not operate beyond its intended purpose. Regular vulnerability testing helps identify and address system weaknesses, mitigating the risk of excessive agency. 5. Track and monitor interactions Effectively tracking and monitoring interactions between users and AI models is vital for ensuring the security and reliability of AI systems. By maintaining detailed logs of all inputs and outputs, for example, using tools like Langfuse , organizations can identify and address potential issues such as prompt injections, data leaks, or other unintended behaviors. Logging provides a comprehensive record that can be analyzed to detect anomalies or patterns that may indicate misuse, enabling swift corrective action. Organizations can prevent harmful or unintended instructions from influencing the AI’s outputs by ensuring that inputs are sanitized. Monitoring interactions also helps identify areas where the AI model may not perform as expected, providing insights into potential biases or inaccuracies in its responses. 6. Label AI-generated output Clearly labeling AI-generated content (i.e., created with AI) helps remind users to critically assess AI outputs, reducing overreliance and reinforcing responsible use. These measures safeguard against potential threats, such as users causing harm or damage by following received faulty information in areas with low expertise, ensuring that AI models remain tools under human oversight rather than independent agents. 7. Evaluate model output When crafting output guardrails, it’s essential to identify factors that could lead to reputational damage or erode trust in the model. These factors might include an inappropriate tone that doesn’t align with the brand, ineffective or incorrectly generated answers, biased or harmful language, or toxic content. Tools like the Moderator API and LLM Guard can effectively review model outputs before sharing them with users. However, merely controlling harmful and toxic content is not enough – responses must also be factually correct, free of hallucinations, reliable, and accurate. At Nortal, we address these challenges with an in-house developed methodology based on scientific research and by utilizing Uptrain and RAGAS frameworks to evaluate the outputs of our AI solutions.

    "content": "Article March 5, 2025 by Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI The key to AI adoption. A GenAI series 2/4 In our previous discussion on the evolving landscape of Generative AI (GenAI), we explored how the rapid advancements in AI accessibility, particularly with OpenAI’s solutions, have shaped the market. With wider adoption, questions of societal readiness and responsibility keep rising when we talk about policies and innovation. Let me explain. Read series part 1 Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise The success of GenAI hinges on trust. People will embrace AI in their daily routines only if they see it as safe, reliable, and valuable. However, trust isn’t automatic—it must be built through transparency, control, and ethical implementation by companies developing AI solutions. What it means is that b eyond corporate responsibility, the broader societal impact of AI adoption must be carefully considered, particularly in education and policy-making. In Estonia, OpenAI and the Estonian government have launched an initiative to provide secondary school students and teachers with access to ChatGPT Edu—a version tailored for educational use. The rollout will begin with 10th and 11th graders by September 2025. Such initiatives are needed and can only thrive when trust in AI is firmly established, ensuring alignment between technological progress and societal expectations. Now applying the same readiness to organizations, challenges are similar. In the early days of GenAI, concerns around data security, ethics, and reliability led to hesitation. While skepticism persists, transparency is key to overcoming these barriers. Organizations must clearly define AI’s role, communicate its capabilities and limitations, and establish responsible AI policies. Setting realistic expectations and continuously educating users will be critical in fostering confidence in AI’s potential. The need for transparent and reasonable AI control Control is a major factor influencing trust in AI. Companies need to strike a balance between AI’s power and ensuring it operates within ethical and regulatory boundaries. AI governance should not be about restricting innovation but rather about implementing structured frameworks that enable responsible AI use. A well-defined AI governance framework should include: – AI Readiness Assessment: Organizations should establish AI maturity matrixes to evaluate their preparedness for AI integration. This can help identify potential risks, gaps, and areas requiring improvement. – Human Oversight: AI should be developed and deployed with human supervision, ensuring critical decision-making processes remain accountable. – Ethical and Regulatory Compliance: Companies must comply with industry-specific regulations and ethical standards while deploying AI-driven solutions. Take the AI readiness assessment AI as a compliance enabler: the case for regulatory agents Interestingly, while AI itself is under scrutiny for regulation, it is also proving to be a valuable compliance tool. One of the most impactful applications of AI is its ability to help organizations within complex regulatory environments. For instance, we developed a Regulatory Agent for a client operating in a heavily regulated industry. The challenge was great—regulations were changing daily, requiring immediate updates to compliance-related documents. GenAI played a crucial role in automating compliance processes, ensuring that regulatory requirements were met in real time, and reducing the risk of non-compliance. This example highlights a paradox: AI, which is often viewed with skepticism, is simultaneously an enabler of transparency and compliance. This duality emphasizes the importance of control mechanisms that do not stifle AI’s potential but rather enhance its responsible use. Read more about Regulatory Assistant Transparency, maturity, and education For AI to thrive in business environments, organizations must prioritize these key areas: data structure and quality, infrastructure utilization, ethics and compliance, AI expertise, and leadership support. AI is here to stay, and its role will only grow in shaping industries and workplaces. The key to successful AI adoption is trust, built through transparency, ethical governance, and proactive education. As organizations navigate this evolving landscape, they must ensure that AI serves as an enabler rather than a disruptor—balancing innovation with responsibility. How? By establishing clear frameworks for AI adoption and compliance, we can foster an environment where AI is trusted, valued, and seamlessly integrated into everyday operations. Then we stay open and honest about all the advancements and ensure the team is on board with the developments. The question is not just about regulating AI but about ensuring its ethical and beneficial use in a rapidly evolving digital world.

    "title": "Elevating data quality with Generative AI",
    "content": "Home Insights Elevating data quality with Generative AI Article January 23, 2024 by Dillon Dayton, Solutions Architect Elevating data quality with Generative AI In today’s world, data is the currency of innovation, and businesses are looking to Generative AI (GenAI) to solve their data issues. We’ll navigate the uncharted waters of how GenAI can mitigate the risks of poor data quality and cultivate an ecosystem of reliable, enriched data. Service Data and AI Industry Consumer Enterprise Healthcare Data is the cornerstone of informed decision-making, strategic foresight, and competitive edge. However, the persistent challenge of ensuring the integrity of data quality remains an ongoing struggle. Conventional approaches fall short in today’s dynamic information landscape. Data arrives from a myriad of sources, in diverse formats, at unprecedented speeds that make traditional methods of quality assurance inadequate. This is where GenAI steps onto the stage, presenting a paradigm shift that redefines how enterprises can ensure data quality. GenAI, a culmination of advanced machine learning and neural network technologies, holds the promise of not just identifying and rectifying data discrepancies, but also of intelligently generating high-quality data. It’s an innovation that transforms the role of AI from being a passive analyzer to an active participant in data enhancement. Let’s explore the most common data quality issues in organizations, how generative AI can help solve or mitigate them, and look at a real-world scenario that demonstrates how generative AI can be used to drive real business value. In the pursuit of success and innovation, we recognize there are far-reaching consequences of poor data quality. Consider the following consequences to data accuracy and integrity Inaccurate Decision-Making Poor data quality threatens the very bedrock of insightful and sound analyses. Business strategies, conceived and executed based on unreliable data, not only run the risk of misdirection but also incur financial losses and missed opportunities. Lost Revenue Inaccurate customer data, ranging from flawed contact details to incomplete purchase histories, directly undermines sales potential and chips away at customer satisfaction. The pernicious billing errors stemming from data inaccuracies manifest as revenue leakage. Customer Dissatisfaction Incorrect or outdated customer information begets woeful customer experiences, such as inundating patrons with irrelevant offers or out-of-touch communications. The collateral damage is substantial, including tarnished brand reputation and eroded customer loyalty. Operational Inefficiencies Inaccurate data ripples through business processes, disrupting supply chains with misplaced inventory data, leading to overstocking or stockouts. This operational chaos incurs lost sales, inflated costs, and disgruntled customers. Regulatory Compliance Risks In an era of stringent data regulations, poor data quality thrusts enterprises into a dangerous tango with non-compliance. The ramifications are dire—penalties, legal entanglements, and the enduring stain on reputation. Reduced Trust in Data When employees and stakeholders continually encounter errors or inconsistencies in data, trust in that data crumbles. Often due to business users creating their own version of the data creating confusion and repeated work. This overall skepticism can translate into a reluctance to rely on data for decision-making, impairing overall enterprise performance. Strained Relationships Poor data quality wreaks havoc on relationships with partners, suppliers, and customers. Inaccurate data sows the seeds of misunderstandings and disputes, fracturing critical alliances and forfeiting future opportunities. Harnessing the Power of GenAI for Your Needs There are many risks that come with continuing to live with poor data quality, but harnessing GenAI offers a wide spectrum of capabilities to help mitigate those risks. From identifying anomalies that signal data quality concerns to streamlining the arduous process of data labeling and cleansing, GenAI stands as a transformative force in an enterprise powered by data. Consider how these intelligent algorithms can reshape the way your organization approaches data quality. Data cleansing: Generating code or scripts for tasks such as parsing, formatting, imputing missing values, and identifying data quality issues, streamlining the data cleaning process and improving efficiency. Labeling and Tagging: Generative models can assist in generating initial labels, tags, and annotations, which can then be refined by human experts in governance or ML applications. Anomaly detection: Learn the normal patterns of data and identify anomalies or outliers that deviate from these patterns. Data imputation: Impute missing values in datasets. By learning patterns from existing data, these models can predict and generate plausible values for missing or incomplete data points. Synthetic Data generation and testing: Create synthetic datasets that mimic the distribution of real-world data. These datasets can be used for testing, validation, and training. Real-World Scenario with Generative AI Consider a prominent research hospital specializing in dermatology and oncology that aims to advance the accuracy of its skin cancer identification models. The hospital’s machine learning team is facing a significant challenge due to the limited availability of diverse and high-quality skin cancer images for training and testing their algorithms. Traditional methods of collecting such data are time-consuming, expensive, and can raise privacy concerns. As previously discussed, a practical application of GenAI is to create synthetic datasets that mimic the distribution of real-world data. These datasets can be used for testing, validation, and training. For our research hospital they feel to overcome their challenges, they need to leverage this technique to create synthetic test data specifically tailored for skin cancer identification models. Benefits: Enhanced Model Performance: The AI-generated synthetic data significantly increases the volume and diversity of the training dataset, resulting in improved model performance and generalization. Privacy and Ethical Compliance: Using synthetic data minimizes privacy concerns and ethical issues associated with using real patient images, as the synthetic data does not contain identifiable information. Cost-Efficiency: Creating synthetic data is cost-effective compared to the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating real images. Faster Development: The hospital can expedite the development and deployment of skin cancer identification models by relying on generative AI for data augmentation. Rare Case Simulation: Synthetic data allows for the simulation of rare skin cancer cases, enabling the model to recognize and diagnose less common conditions accurately. By employing generative AI to create synthetic test data, the research hospital can accelerate the advancement of skin cancer identification models, ultimately leading to more accurate and early diagnoses, improved patient outcomes, and valuable contributions to dermatological research.

    "content": "Article May 6, 2025 by Nortal Beyond copilots: The rise of AI agents and enterprise AI Autonomous and integrated AI is more than a collection of copilots – it’s a strategic necessity. Service Data and AI Copilots won’t transform your business. Autonomous AI agents will. The AI conversation has been dominated by personal assistants and copilots - tools that help individuals work faster. But the real value of AI isn’t in helping a few employees write quicker emails or summarize documents. The next frontier is far more transformative: autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI . These aren’t just tools. They are strategic assets - AI systems that learn, act, and make decisions across your organization without constant human oversight. While copilots assist, AI agents can operate, optimize, and orchestrate entire business functions . The companies already building these capabilities aren’t just getting more efficient - they're redefining how they compete, serve customers, and create new value. In this article, we’ll explore: What autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI really are Why copilots are no longer enough The levels of automation and how to evolve toward autonomy Real-world use cases showing how leaders in manufacturing, public services, and supply chains are using AI agents today The conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) often centers on personal tools like copilots and other AI assistants that can help with specific tasks at different levels of the organization. However, AI's true potential and value extend far beyond these tools. The two concepts that will transform how businesses operate and compete - and that every decision-maker should watch - are autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI . What are AI agents and Enterprise AI, and why should you care? AI agents refer to AI systems designed to act independently, make decisions, and perform tasks without constant human intervention. They can learn from data, adapt to new information, and execute complex processes, making them invaluable in dynamic environments. Enterprise AI, conversely, encompasses a broader integration of AI technologies across an organization's entire ecosystem. This includes holistic data management and analytics in functions and processes from finance to procurement and from customer service to supply chain optimization. Enterprise AI aims to enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and drive innovation by leveraging AI at every business level. It is about creating a cohesive strategy that aligns with the company's goals and processes. The need for autonomous agents and Enterprise AI arises from the limitations of the known personal AI applications like copilots. While copilots can assist with specific tasks, they lack the autonomy and scalability to address modern enterprises' complex challenges. Businesses today need AI solutions that can operate independently, integrate seamlessly with existing systems and business processes, and provide actionable insights that drive growth and efficiency. Essentially, they transform AI from a helpful assistant into a strategic partner that propels the business forward. The s tepwise e volution t owards a utonomous AI a gents While the first wave of generative AI brought us copilots and other personal AI assistants, it didn’t yet revolutionize our lives as advertised—or feared, depending on the viewpoint. Some even labelled the copilots as Clippy 2.0 , referring to the notorious Microsoft Office assistant from the late 90s. While copilots have advantages over Clippy, assistants for humans can only increase productivity to a point. The transformation from AI assistants to autonomous agents will revolutionize entire processes and how we do business. However, transitioning from manual human-led processes to full automation involves going through different levels, ranging from simple task automation to fully autonomous decision-making systems. The levels of automation can be categorized as follows: Manual Systems: human intervention for all tasks and decision-making Assisted Automation: AI systems provide recommendations and insights, humans make decisions Partial Automation: human oversight for complex decisions, but AI systems perform tasks autonomously Conditional Automation: AI systems handle most tasks, but human intervention needed in limited conditions or scenarios High Automation: minimal human intervention, AI systems perform most tasks autonomously Full Automation: AI systems are independent, make decisions and execute without human involvement Smarter Decision-Making : AI helps businesses process vast amounts of data, enabling leaders to make informed decisions quickly. From predictive analytics to real-time insights, AI empowers organizations to capture opportunities faster than ever before. Operational Efficiency : By automating routine tasks, AI frees up human resources to focus on more strategic, value-adding initiatives. This leads to cost savings, improved productivity, and enhanced operational capabilities. Customer Experience : AI’s ability to personalize customer interactions in real time leads to higher satisfaction, loyalty, and competitive advantage. With AI-driven customer insights, businesses can anticipate needs, reduce friction, and drive long-term relationships. Innovation and Growth : AI is not just about automation - it’s about unlocking new value streams . Whether it’s enhancing product offerings or creating entirely new business models, AI opens the door to new growth opportunities. 1 2 3 4 When climbing higher up on the automation level, data and AI solutions built for analytical and user-interface-focused needs will not suffice. New API-driven solutions are needed to drive and automate complex business processes without human intervention. By understanding and leveraging these different levels of automation, organizations can gradually transition from manual systems to fully autonomous agents, unlocking new opportunities for efficiency and innovation. Despite the breathtaking speed of advancements and changes in the AI landscape, the shift to fully autonomous systems making independent decisions will not happen overnight. From our perspective, human oversight will still be needed in the short term. Capturing the value of Enterprise AI While some of Enterprise AI's value lies in increasing operational efficiency and unlocking the full potential of a company's data assets and processes, it ultimately enables organizations to discover new value streams, rethink their core processes, and innovate new businesses. To successfully implement Enterprise AI, an organization needs a solid data and AI strategy backed up by a scalable enterprise architecture. The strategy defines a clear vision and key performance indicators (KPI). It directs the supporting governance structure and builds a robust data platform that includes secure data storage, efficient processing capabilities, and scalable cloud solutions. Seamless integration with existing operational and IT systems and processes requires interfaces and middleware that connect various data sources and applications within your organization. Our next article will discuss building data governance models and platforms in more detail. Once prerequisites are met, adopting Enterprise AI can be transformative. It enhances decision-making by leveraging vast data for actionable insights, leading to better strategies and a competitive edge. It boosts operational efficiency by automating tasks, reducing costs, and freeing up human resources for strategic initiatives. Enterprise AI can help personalize customer experiences in real time, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. Predictive analytics enables anticipating trends, behaviors, and risks, allowing businesses to mitigate challenges and seize opportunities. AI agents in action: examples from our customer verticals Business leaders may still be skeptical about integrating AI into the highest levels of strategic and tactical work.

    "title": "From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI",
    "content": "Home Insights From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI Article May 23, 2024 by Dragan Gajic, CTO | Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and foundational artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the AI landscape has undergone a seismic shift. AI is democratizing and making its benefits accessible to companies and organizations of all shapes and sizes. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Traditionally, the barrier to entry for AI adoption was high. Organizations needed substantial amounts of quality data, robust and expensive infrastructure for training models, and a skilled workforce proficient in machine learning and data science. Consequently, only big tech companies could afford the investment required to harness the power of AI effectively. However, the emergence of large language models has drastically reduced these barriers, making AI accessible to businesses of all sizes and industries. Creating the right AI solution for your organization doesn’t have to take significant investments in teams and hardware anymore. And with the competition in the GenAI market heating up, the price is pressed to come down even more in the next five years. Today, AI is no longer a luxury but a necessity for gaining a competitive edge in the market. How to win with AI In Gartner’s 2023 poll of more than 1,400 executive leaders, 45% reported that they are in piloting mode with generative AI, and another 10% have put generative AI solutions into production. And as an assurance to their investments, an Accenture study reveals that companies that adopt AI early and comprehensively show higher profit margins and improved performance compared to their peers. But beyond mere competitiveness, organizations leverage AI to streamline internal processes and enhance operational efficiency. Business processes are the very core of every organization and making these more efficient is what really makes the difference. The real win comes from making your organization work better. However, like often with many technologies, in business, much of AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Even more, it is important to focus on the problem that needs to be solved rather than the approach that will be used. The biggest value lies in knowing your business and having the tools to solve possible problems and make the processes more efficient. When we understand the challenge, the most appropriate approach will emerge for addressing it, be it a combination of different LLM models to achieve the best quality or an on-premises solution to protect your data. The importance of data in AI There is no AI without data. That is what it is trained on; that is what it eats. However, a popular saying goes: Garbage in, garbage out. It even has its own often-used acronym GIGO. In short, poor data produces poor results. If the data you use for your AI tool is of poor quality or faulty, it is unlikely that good or truthful results will be achieved by applying LLMs to the data. It is important not to overlook the significance of having a robust data architecture, high-quality data, and well-designed interfaces for interacting with the data. Seamless experiences: AI shaping productivity and ways of working We believe that at the core of this AI-driven transformation lies the concept of seamless experiences. Whether it’s improving customer interactions or enhancing employee productivity, the goal remains the same: to create frictionless experiences. In EY’s 2023 Work Reimagined survey of both employee and employer survey respondents, a net positive 33% see AI’s potential benefits for productivity and new ways of working, with a net positive 44% seeing benefits to the reality of flexible working. By leveraging AI-driven tools and solutions, organizations can streamline mundane tasks, leading to a rise in strategic actions and personalized experiences. That is also driving AI toward near-future developments centered around human-machine collaboration. By delegating monotonous and time-consuming tasks to computers, we free up valuable time and cognitive resources to focus on strategic decision-making. Gartner predicts that by 2026, over 100 million humans will engage robocolleagues to contribute to their work. And that by 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop. This is not happening at all today. For software companies, integrating AI into their own work processes and solutions is no longer optional but imperative. Data and AI have become indispensable software development components, enabling companies to deliver innovative, intelligent, and value-generating solutions to their customers. According to Accenture , AI is projected to boost labor productivity by up to 40% by 2035, unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation across industries. Get on board or get left behind Where to get started with your AI adoption? There is a common myth that AI projects take years to complete. But the evolution of AI is so fast that you cannot afford to have huge, 2-year projects. But unlike a myth, the fact is that a lot can be delivered with 2-3 months. Before the wide public adoption of large language models, following the leading edge with ChatGPT as the frontrunner, we built our data and analysis solution, Tark . Tark has helped our customers analyze and visualize their structured and unstructured data and generate insights and recommendations for continuous improvement. Learn more Catalyst for organizational change To create seamless experiences, we must be technology agnostic and early adopters. Because of this belief and the actions behind it, we can leverage our long experience in data and AI projects to save time and money for our customers. AI is not merely a technology but a catalyst for organizational transformation. To thrive in today’s fast-paced and competitive landscape, businesses must be agile, adaptive, and efficient. Embracing new technologies and leveraging data-driven insights are critical to achieving operational excellence and driving sustainable growth. In the Gartner poll , 78% of respondents believe that the benefits of generative AI outweigh its risks, and this number has risen since the previous poll. However, privacy should not be pushed aside to take advantage of GenAI. We believe that fully understanding the importance of the discovery phase can mitigate many of the risks – to truly know your company’s goals, where it stands, and the limitations of your AI project. For example, it is possible to choose which data to use, run your GenAI solution completely on-premises if you do not feel comfortable using the cloud, or create a hybrid solution in which some of the data sits on the cloud and more sensitive data is kept on-premises. The key is knowing your possibilities and tailoring your GenAI solution to your exact needs with the right authorization matrix. The same goes for ethics. While AI holds immense potential, it also raises critical ethical concerns that demand careful consideration. Generative AI models are usually trained on vast amounts of uncontrolled data that can amplify existing biases or breach copyright laws. While data diversity and model governance can alleviate some of the risks, it is important that the models be transparent, that clear human oversight still remains over their results, and that clear accountability and liability mechanisms are established. Even though AI is evolving quickly, it is still considered an emerging technology with its own risks. Therefore, in delivering AI solutions, we know it is important not to overpromise, be transparent, and work closely with the client. The key to unlocking AI’s full potential is its application to real-world business cases. From automating repetitive tasks to optimizing resource allocation, AI-powered solutions can address a myriad of challenges faced by organizations across various industries. By collaborating with AI experts and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, businesses can unlock new opportunities, drive innovation, and stay ahead of the curve.

This shift not only enhances the equity of government services but also significantly elevates efficiency and sustainability. The journey toward personal government is already on its way in several societies. This white paper discusses the desired outcomes and impact of personal government, but also proposes known and explored key capabilities to create it. Download the full white paper Empowering users with means that traditional services cannot One of the most significant problems still to be solved in public administration and service delivery is to provide equitable and high-quality public services sustainably. Traditionally, only another human could render services in a way that felt human. But now, we can surpass human capability to deliver high-quality services while assuring the sustainable renewal of services. We have learned that by simplifying complex processes and the intelligent use of technology, we can increase public approval and efficiency – at the same time. Digital is the means to an end, not the point itself While personal government requires and evolves from the strong digital government foundation, the emphasis is on simply providing a better public service experience and efficient public administration. Many organizations (including the World Bank and OECD) have started to call the equivalent evolutionary step from the digital government era the GovTech era. In this era people have more control over their data to build trust. Services are shifting from a government-focused to a citizen-centered approach. Modern platforms provide smoother experiences and foster innovation. And AI can step in where current methods fall short, making service delivery more efficient. Envisioning the next era for public services To explore public services in the era of personal government, we highlight five key traits: human-centricity, accessibility, proactiveness, trustworthiness, and empowerment. Ready to journey to the Personal Government The full realization of the goals of personal government requires the adoption of emerging technologies and the reorganization of the government’s working principles in terms of service provision and cooperation between institutions. All these capabilities are either already well within today’s technological development or within reach and can be realized in the foreseeable future.

    "content": "White Paper June 19, 2023 Proactive Public Services – the new standard for digital governments Following the first wave of public sector digitization that focused on making services accessible online, governments are seeking to increasingly automate public services, so that they require as little interaction from users and service providers as possible. Proactive public services represent the pinnacle of this new wave of digital public services. In their most sophisticated form, these digital public services can be designed entirely without user interaction, offering unparalleled frictionless access to public services. Download the full white paper Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Government Transformation This white paper aims to help those who wish to understand, and potentially develop, proactive public services. It discusses the concept of proactive public services as the next phase of digitization in the public sector. The paper showcases examples from Austria, Estonia, and New Zealand, where proactive public services of differing levels of sophistication have been developed, implemented, and trialed for several years. Drawing on these cases, the paper presents new insights and lessons learned, identifies the core building blocks for developing proactive public services, and concludes by offering recommendations on how to successfully transition to a more proactive public sector. User-friendly government services With minimal user interaction required, Proactive public services are at the cutting-edge of service design by being as user-friendly as possible. Yet, their potential to increase the effectiveness of policies underlying public services is even more remarkable. Redesigning public services into proactive public services extends their reach by making it unnecessary for potential users to even be aware of them or must apply for them. This may especially benefit the most socially disadvantaged groups in society, who often already have the hardest journey for obtaining government services. Wide-scale introduction of proactive public services may therefore even contribute to a more socially just and equitable society. Implementing proactive public services at scale requires organizational capabilities, stakeholder management, and evaluating each public service’s potential for proactive delivery. Governments need to raise awareness, build necessary foundations, and develop capabilities to successfully implement proactive public services. Download the full white paper Improved service delivery efficiency At the same time, proactive public services can help push the boundaries of automation in the delivery of public services as governments face mounting pressure to harness digitization to improve service delivery efficiency. Proactive public services can help governments fulfill citizens’ increasing expectations that digital public services be provided with the same user friendliness as private sector digital services. It also has the potential to reduce costs and required personnel, freeing up public funds to tackle the most pressing challenges of our time, such as climate change, and mitigating the impact of increasing labor shortages in the public sector, which confront many developed countries. Proactive public services are part of a wider transformation towards proactive government that delivers users public services without waiting for formal requests. It implies a capacity to anticipate societal and economic developments, as well as users’ needs, by capturing real-time information and applying it to re-design services. Some of the most digitally advanced nations in the world have begun the path towards proactive government by successfully implementing the first proactive public services. However, even the most digitally advanced nations have only been able to implement a small number of proactive public services to date. Their experience shows that building these services is significantly more complex than other types of digital public services. Creating sophisticated proactive public services requires a strong foundation of environmental, technical, and organizational building blocks. This includes a supportive regulatory environment that enables the inter-agency exchange of personal data, a requirement to implement many advanced proactive public services. A high level of trust in the public sector is also essential to create a desire to experiment with and transition to this mode of digital public services and ensure continuous support for it. Proactive public services aim to automate public services to minimize user and service provider interaction, providing frictionless access to government services. This approach not only enhances user-friendliness but also has the potential to increase policy effectiveness and promote social equity.

Secure data exchange The ability to exchange personal data securely and efficiently within all areas of a public administration, and ideally the health and private sectors. Electronic messaging Secure and legally binding electronic messaging between the public sector, citizens, and businesses. Transforming into a proactive government requires comprehensive preparation The complexity of implementing proactive public services at scale is nothing short of a stress test for public administrations’ organizational capabilities. Re-designing digital public services from a reactive to a proactive approach demands an in-depth understanding of the processes and organizations involved, as well as the ability and mindset to completely re-think them. Implementing proactive public services will often drastically increase the complexity of stakeholder management as it often requires cooperation between several government agencies. These foundational factors combined with the individual characteristics of each public service determine whether a public service can be re-designed as a proactive public service, and how far its delivery can be automated. Download the white paper Building the necessary foundation and capabilities To start implementing proactive public services, public administrations must understand its possibilities and evaluate the potential for each public service. This white paper’s accompanying materials offer guidance on how to evaluate public services’ potential to be delivered as a proactive public service. A set of guiding questions is published to help interested public service providers evaluate individual public services regarding their suitability to be delivered proactively. Due to this transformation’s wide-ranging implications, it will require politicians, civil service leaders and the public’s continuous support. Thus, a first step must be to raise awareness of proactive government’s potential, as well as realistic expectations of the time and effort needed for this transformation. Experimenting and implementing less sophisticated types of proactive public services, such as proactive information, may be useful to gain experience and raise awareness, even for governments that lack the right foundation. However, a full-scale transformation to proactive government is unlikely to succeed without a solid foundation of technical building blocks and the right public administration capabilities. Providing proactive public services must become a question of “how” and “when” – not “if”. This will require public sector organizations to develop new capabilities and understandings on how services should be designed proactively. Without this, they will face many challenges – some of which may be insurmountable.

    "content": "The state of AI-ready data in local government New insights from UK councils on standards, readiness and reform, and how public data is evolving to support search, machine learning and generative AI. Read the research report Service Digital Transformation Industry Government The councils that modernise their data will modernise their services fastest. Across the UK, local authorities are discovering that data is no longer a by-product of bureaucracy but the raw material for automation. When structured for search, prediction and conversation, it cuts costs, sharpens policy and powers a new wave of citizen-centred services. Local governments’ datasets are no longer about accountability alone; they are becoming the fuel of automation. Where readiness meets results Ten case studies, from Dorset’s predictive budgeting to London’s fire-risk modelling, reveal both progress and fragmentation. Most councils now publish open data, but few prepare it for reuse. Machine-readable metadata remains scarce, and standards are patchy. Where they do align – ISO dates, UPRNs, SNOMED CT – AI tools deliver faster insights, more accurate forecasts and measurable savings. The evidence is clear: readiness is not about scale or budget, but about the discipline of standards and governance. Read the case studies These variations point to a deeper truth: AI is not a single capability but a family of tools, each with its own data demands. Different AIs, different data demands AI readiness is too often treated as a box to tick. In reality, what makes data “fit for AI” depends on the purpose. The datasets that drive a chatbot will fail a forecasting model; what works for search may break predictive analytics. For councils, recognising these distinctions is essential to making sound investments. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. From data maturity to data purpose ODI and Nortal propose a framework that treats readiness as a toolkit, not a ladder: Search readiness: clean metadata, canonical identifiers and machine-readable schemas. Machine-learning readiness: structured, balanced data at scale with clear provenance. Generative-AI readiness: annotated corpora and APIs built for retrieval and conversation. Search readiness underpins transparency and efficiency; machine-learning readiness supports foresight and planning; and generative readiness opens the door to new forms of citizen interaction. Each requires its own standards, governance and infrastructure, but together they give councils flexible pathways to modernise services and build trust. These are not stages of maturity but lenses of purpose – transparency, foresight and trust – giving councils practical routes to modernise services without waiting for perfect systems. Explore the framework Decisions make data ready, or not Every dataset reflects a decision — about structure, standard, governance or neglect. Those choices shape whether councils can anticipate crises or merely record them. The report offers a toolkit for turning data into capability: adopt standards, publish metadata, automate pipelines and separate operational from strategic data.

    "content": "Best practices in public procurement for continuous modernization Use outcome-driven procurement for innovation, resilience and efficiency Download the playbook Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Governments struggle to modernize mission-critical systems Finance, justice, social welfare, health care and defense all rely on government IT – too often built on fragile, decades-old infrastructure. Traditional procurement (long contracts, rigid specs, big-bang delivery) drives overruns, delays and solutions that miss user needs. The result is rising technical debt, mounting cyber risk and high-profile failures when large replacements collapse under their own weight. In the United States alone, more than $100 billion a year goes to federal IT, much of it just to keep legacy systems running. Doing nothing is not sustainable as public expectations keep rising. The system that created the barriers can dismantle them. Procurement is a strategic lever for change and innovation Public procurement is not just an administrative process. In many countries it represents 12% to 15% of GDP – enough market power to shape innovation, competitiveness and how public services evolve. Used well, it can unlock cutting-edge solutions and preserve public control over critical infrastructure and data. Used poorly, it can stall digital transformation. Learn more in the playbook Public procurement accounts for 12–15% of GDP in many countries – a tremendous influence on markets and innovation. A modular, adaptive procurement approach The private sector modernizes continuously – short cycles, iterative upgrades and faster integration of new tech without disrupting service. Governments can do the same when procurement rules enable agility, innovation and collaboration while safeguarding accountability. Shifting to continuous modernization requires clear goals that balance innovation with stewardship. Seven shifts for procurement reform Enable continuous innovation. Replace one-off projects with flexible, outcome-based contracts and agile pilots. Grow the ecosystem. Use procurement to stimulate domestic industry, small businesses and startups while pulling innovation into the market. Open the door wider. Simplify tenders and split work into smaller lots so more diverse suppliers can compete. Focus on value, not just cost. Use life-cycle criteria such as most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) to deliver the best outcomes per taxpayer dollar. Advance sustainability and social value. Embed green standards, accessibility and fair labor in tenders. Protect trust through transparency . Ensure open competition, clear rules, auditability and open contracting data. Safeguard sovereignty and resilience. Maintain national oversight of critical data and infrastructure, avoid lock-in and build in cybersecurity from the start.

    "content": "Home Insights Bettering bureaucracy with a Single Digital Gateway Case study August 22, 2024 Bettering bureaucracy with a Single Digital Gateway Together with Estonia’s Information System Authority, Nortal has created a GovTech system that powers Estonia’s integration into the European single market by enabling information-sharing across 26 EU countries, all at different stages of digitalization, all with different backend systems. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government This system aligns with the EU’s Single Digital Gateway (SDG) mandate—a legislative directive aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles across Europe. You’re a Belgian who wants to retire and collect her pension in Spain. You’re a German entrepreneur whose business pays taxes in Ireland and France. We’ve built the technology that makes this possible, one which allows Estonian citizens to share over 250 legal certificates, in 48 areas of citizen information, throughout 46 business systems—all with 26 other nations. It’s a system that unites nations at different stages of their digitalization journeys, nations with disparate data, and makes the single market truly single. Cross-border chaos Cross-border paperwork is an unavoidable feature of any single market. The administrative process must be unified to enable university student exchange programs, to register a car in another domicile, and enable entrepreneurs to start businesses abroad. Every nation’s paperwork requirements are different, and requirements may differ at institutions within a nation. One university in Spain may want your high school diploma, another requires proof of income eligibility for scholarships. Different documents are needed and they are uploaded and downloaded on different platforms. When accessing hundreds of legacy systems across which data is scattered, users’ documents are located in a variety of government offices working in silos, making it time consuming to get documents for opening a business, changing schools, or any other bureaucratic task. Multiple log-ins may be required to chase down information and, at the personal level, it becomes an exercise in frustration. At the societal level, it’s a massive waste of resources. Calculations show that for the European Union, a single digital gateway (SDG) could help companies save 11 billion euros, and relieve citizens of 885,000 hours of labor. The single digital gateway For Europe, the solution is the SDG. The system is flexible enough to allow nations and organizations to keep their own systems, choose their own technology, yet it creates an SDG layer which enables sharing. For citizen and business it means controlling their own data, with documents retrieved and shared automatically within the single market. Our solution, developed in close collaboration with the Estonian Information System Authority, included strategy and innovation consulting for legal changes in state law and was delivered in four months to the Estonia Information System Authority. It was tested in 63 cases in cooperation with eight other member nations of the European Union. Future-proof architecture We applied a broad architectural approach in Estonia as it continues to learn how the SDG fits into the Estonian architectural landscape, and works to ensure scalability in response to potential EU changes. For example, considerations include how an ID matching application will function in the future and how it will integrate into the SDG workflow. GovSSO (single sign-on) is incorporated in solution design, meaning a good user experience with significantly fewer sign-ons. We embraced testing and actively participated in all EU-held technical and business roundtable meetings and joint conformance testing events. Although these are not mandatory, they offer valuable insights into future application functionalities and opportunities for early improvements. Killing it with KPIs In just six months, Nortal built a fully functioning system for Estonia, exceeding the KPIs set by the Estonian Information System Authority by 230%. Developed from scratch, this system earned top recognition at a Europe-wide testing event , further validating its outstanding performance. The implementation of the single digital gateway is estimated to save Estonia three- to four million euros in direct costs, as well as a similar amount in future maintenance costs. The full development of the intermediary platform was completed in just 12 months. Over the next three year, Estonia’s full implementation will be built out to encompass the entire infrastructure, and it is all being constructed in accordance to EU specifications at a budget manageable by the Estonian state. But just as diverse, dispersed data is not just a European problem, SDGs are not just a European solution. In any nation or government where there are de-centralized states, provinces, or entities, the situation is the same – disunity, inconsistency, and a plethora of legacy systems. But the citizen does not have to suffer.

    "content": "Home Insights Estonia moves towards a seamless society with proactive public services Case study October 3, 2022 Estonia moves towards a seamless society with proactive public services Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Proactive government services aim to make easy, convenient, and efficient public services available for citizens to save them time and resources, but most importantly, to create a state that keeps citizens’ needs at its very core. Estonia, a country widely regarded as a truly digital society, made yet another innovative leap at the end of 2019 by launching proactive family and parental benefits, moving toward a new proactive governance model. Rethinking digitalization Innovation in government services is not simply moving its services online but foreseeing its citizens’ needs and providing support throughout key events in their lives, whether it is the birth of a child, purchasing a home, or retirement. This presumes an active role from the state, requiring a redesign of reactive government processes into event-based services. The new method significantly simplifies citizens’ lives by turning burdensome bureaucracy into a seamless user experience and proactive aid to those in need. Challenge Fragmented information The main challenge with reactive public services is that citizens need to contact the state to determine the rights and benefits to which they are entitled. Often, this requires visiting a government office, examining voluminous information, and submitting numerous agency applications. Meanwhile, the citizens most in need of government support are also the most at risk if required to manage these complexities. Estonia’s first proactive service of family and parental benefits aims to make life easier for parents. Before this, the information was fragmented, and parents lacked confidence that they had the necessary details about the applicable benefits. Furthermore, there was zero automation, and only 15% of benefits were based on offers. And even those proposals were processed by hand, resulting in laborious manual work for state officials and taking up to 65 minutes to process one person’s application. Solution Parental benefits with a click of a button In October 2019, parents in Estonia received a proactive offer for benefits for the first time via self-service portal. This means that parents of a newborn no longer need to apply for benefits but receive a proactive proposal from the government for the benefits they are entitled to, which they simply have to confirm. When a child is born, the entry made in the population register will activate all follow-on services without the parents having to apply. The proposal directs the parent to a self-service portal where they can accept the offer with the click of a button. The parents are informed of the benefits they are entitled to, the sum they are entitled to, the calculations their benefits are based on, when the benefits are paid out, and what they should do next. To allow this, an automated system based on complex algorithms operates in the background. This system supports a comprehensive data analysis, comprising more than 80 unique conditions to consider, which creates detailed information concerning who is eligible for benefits and in what amount. When family conditions change, the system validates data via various registers to approve the benefits and the entitled sums. Furthermore, Estonian digital services are based on the once-only principle , meaning that the government can ask citizens for their information only once. When needed, the same information can be requested by other public administration offices via secure data exchange. Proactive services, thus, utilize the databases and registries that already hold extensive information about citizens. When the proposal for benefits is sent proactively, all the data is collected from these databases, making it unnecessary for the citizen to provide that same information repeatedly. Once a country defines the problem and identifies the target group, it can quickly deliver benefits to those in need. 91% customer satisfaction with the proactive public service 88% reduction in direct customer contacts per month for state officials 99,99% of registered births are checked automatically to determine eligibility for parental benefits Result Anticipating citizens’ needs Today, 99.99% of registered births in Estonia are checked automatically to determine eligibility for parental benefits. Therefore, new parents can devote their time to a new family member instead of dealing with paperwork and validating if their rights are served, and they have all the information needed. Furthermore, due to proactive services, state officials have more resources to direct their efforts into providing quality service and information to citizens. When automated processes take care of most of the standard cases, state officials have more time to pay attention to special cases. For example, when people eligible for benefits would not apply, whether by lack of awareness or other reasons, thereby reducing the number of non-take-up cases. Impact A state that serves its citizens Proactive public services are the future because of the simplicity of services for citizens and the government. It saves time and resources by eliminating the need for citizens to visit government offices and for officials to process each application’s data manually. The government offers its services and aid proactively. However, what is unique about proactive public services, in addition to their seamless user experience, is the matter of social justice. Proactive public services help ensure government policies are effective and reach the people for whom they are intended. Finally, the proactive service increasingly optimizes costs, generates higher added value, and significantly increases citizens’ satisfaction. Proactive Public Services – the new standard for digital governments Proactive public services aim to automate public services to minimize user and service provider interaction, providing frictionless access to government services. This approach not only enhances user-friendliness but also has the potential to increase policy effectiveness and promote social equity.

    "content": "Home Insights Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Case study September 5, 2022 Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Service Data and AI eCensus Seamless Experiences Industry Government Real-Time Economy e-Census and Statistics In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts. At the end of a tumultuous year of COVID restrictions and lockdowns in 2020, the Sultanate of Oman completed a fully register-based census on their first try. Thus, allowing the country to run a one-click census at any time and react to population changes quickly and efficiently. Government innovation The evolution of the census Throughout time, census data has been used to inform and direct policy. However, how censuses are conducted has changed with the advancement of technology. In 1440, the Incas, who didn’t have a written language, used a system of knots on strings made from llama or alpaca hair to record census data and administer their empire. In 2020, 580 years later, Oman conducted a fully-register-based census with all three registries on their first try. Oman’s method was even highlighted by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) as an international model of shifting from a traditional census to a register-based census. In the past 20 years, Oman has put a strong emphasis on digitalization. As a result, the country’s eGovernment Development Index has risen from 0.3548 (rank 98) in 2003 to 0.7749 (rank 50) in 2020. The one-click census is another excellent example of this digital transformation journey. 1993 Civil register established 2003 National Strategy for Digital Society and eGovernance 2009 National Data Centre (NDC) inaugurated 2010 Oman National Computer Emergency Readiness Team (OCERT) launched 2012 Digital Transformation program commences 2014 Government cloud G-Cloud launched 2016 Invest Easy portal launched 2017 Tax Management System for Corporate Income Tax implemented 2018 e-Justice System “Tawtheeq” launched 2020 First e-Census completed Challenge The transformation of the census in Oman Oman conducted its first census in 1993, with subsequent censuses in 2003 and 2010. The traditional census has two main drains — time and money. It costs a lot to conduct and takes time to get the results. The 2010 census combined door-to-door visits by enumerators and an online questionnaire. In total, close to 6,600 people were involved in the process, with costs ranging from salaries, transportation, and per diems to post-census analysis and publication costs. In addition, much of the data entry and processing was manual, opening it up to errors. For the 2020 census , Oman was forward-thinking and embraced innovation fully. We worked closely with the National Center for Statistics and Information to create a data processing strategy, architecture design and to develop the e-Census project. As a result, the Sultanate became one of a few countries at a global level and the first in the Arab world to conduct a census that relied entirely on data collection through administrative records. The data obtained and the indicators provided by the census are vital for enhancing Oman Vision 2040 and have important implications for the developmental planning of all sectors of the Sultanate. – Taavi Einaste, CEO, Middle East and Africa Oman’s successful fully register-based census is a huge step toward real-time decision making, which on a national level can lead to better efficiency, quicker policy-making, and happier people. Solution A fully register-based census This approach takes advantage of the input received from various administrative registers. The data is cross-referenced using advanced extract, load, and transformation practices to obtain the necessary information for census readiness. A key goal of the e-Census 2020 project was to implement population, housing, and establishment hubs that update in near real-time — as soon as an entry is made into the administrative registers. Together with the ambitious team at National Center of Statistical Information (NCSI), Nortal successfully established common data exchange standards, which were used by 24 administrative registers that provided data for the census. Using state-of-the-art technology, the e-Census 2020 solution can ingest millions of records from various administrative registers. Statistical classifications are applied using the metadata, followed by technical and logical data validation checks. The statistical authority in Oman works with aggregated data, therefore maintaining the privacy of its citizens and residents. Eventually, census methodology is applied to the data from registers, and geospatial data is processed to support the census. The output is then disseminated through the e-Census online portal. The entire process is fully automated, enabling Oman to execute an on-demand census at any time. 4.5m People counted 95% Data quality 100m+ Records processed Impact First in the Arab world On December 14, 2020, His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik endorsed the results of the e-Census 2020 of Population, Residences and Establishments, which showed that as of December 12, 2020 the population of the Sultanate stood at 4,471,148. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, the e-Census 2020 was executed on schedule. Oman became the first nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers in a single census on the first attempt. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. Oman became the first country in the GCC to achieve a 100% register-based census in 2020. 1st 1st nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers on the first attempt. 23m About 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census. 74 Only 74 employees worked on the 2020 census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. The foundation of a proactive government The e-Census is only the first step. It provides policymakers with crucial information for understanding population changes in different regions and categories to be able to plan for the future. Furthermore, it allows the government to communicate with its citizens proactively, based on their needs, preferences, and life events, such as marriage or birth of a child. For example, birth data allows the government to automatically share information about benefits and other helpful information for new parents. Or in relation to higher education, the government can use data about university students and their specializations to plan jobs and other employment enablement plans for the youth entering the job market. Designing and implementing proactive services allows the government to increase engagement and offer excellent value to its citizens and residents. – Tomy Bosco, Business Area Director It has been a real privilege to work on this project with the NCSI and the Sultanate of Oman. I think Oman is a true global trailblazer – demonstrating how technology can accelerate and enable public services. Transforming governments, transforming societies The right digital tools applied properly can dramatically transform citizen-government interaction, changing the way societies work. A digitally-enabled government is citizen-centric, proactively meeting needs when it comes to social security and taxation. It literally changes the way citizens interact with and experience their government.

    "content": "White Paper January 23, 2023 Digitalizing government services: Make it proactive, intuitive and fast Service Experience and Design Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government When it comes to government services, the citizens, residents, and businesses of a country want fast, intuitive, proactive services. Digitalization has created the perfect environment for that vision – as countries that have already developed versions of a government ‘super app’ have discovered. Challenges Invisible services The aim of a modern government is to create an environment that allows all its citizens, residents, and businesses to fulfill their own goals and dreams. In an ideal world, the best government service would be no (obvious) service. This is the future of proactive services – a world where, ideally, services are delivered so unobtrusively that the process is almost invisible. Digitalization has brought that vision within reach. Solution A unified platform The essential foundation of this vision is a platform that connects the information system and data of every government department, allowing citizens, businesses, visitors, and others to communicate efficiently with the state. For citizens and residents, this means they can access what they need and find answers to questions through a single digital environment. For businesses and investors, it means a seamless and efficient business environment. And for governments, it means greater efficiency and productivity and a flexible system that’s fit for the future. The principles for success People-centric People are the absolute focus of the system. The experience should be intuitive, relevant, and personal, with services based around life event journeys. Future facing The system should be built with the future in mind. If the foundations of the system are robust and everything is digitalized, new services can easily be added, integrated, and managed. Secure and private A single, high-security authentication point for the public sector. Citizens, institutions, and companies should only have to provide certain standard information to the authorities and administrations once. – Forbes Estonia has given an entirely different outlook on what a truly human-centric society entails for digital citizens. The evolution of e-services worldwide While businesses have been at the forefront of the drive to harness the potential of e-services, a small number of countries worldwide are leading the way in digital government. In Malta and Portugal, for example, around 98% of government services are available online. In 2020, the E-Government Development Index ranked the 193 United Nations Member States in terms of digital government. Denmark, the Republic of Korea, and Estonia ranked as the most developed. The rapid shift from desktop-based internet access to mobile services is taking e-government to the next level. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2023, Estonia unveiled a new smartphone app, mRiik, which will allow its citizens to access government services and hold digital versions of their ID card, passport, and other key documents. Parental benefits with the click of a button Estonia, a country widely regarded as a truly digital society, made yet another innovative leap at the end of 2019 by launching proactive family and parental benefits, moving toward a new proactive governance model.

    "content": "Article October 20, 2024 by Bobby Chandan, Client Principal at Nortal It’s time to exploit the next generation of innovative public service solutions With rising demand, the cost-of-living crisis, and broader geopolitical instability, it’s clear we need to adopt new approaches to build trust in the government’s ability to use modern technology effectively. Service Data and AI Industry Government The doom loop of rising costs and stagnant productivity Many of us feel that our local public services are facing significant challenges. At the more trivial end, my street isn’t swept as often, and I’m now paying for garden waste collection for the first time. However, a much more serious issue is the lack of coordination between health and social care services, which I experienced last year. This almost led to my dad being critically neglected, had I not been there to join the dots between different agencies. As we approach the Autumn Budget and 2025 Spending Review, the pressure on public services has never been greater. Local authorities are grappling with severe financial strain, driven by inflation, wage pressures, and increasing demand for services. The financial sustainability of many councils is at risk, with some already reliant on exceptional financial support from Central Government. The “Place-Based Public Service Budgets” report published by New Local earlier this year highlighted issues like fragmented funding, short-term crisis management, and a lack of coordination between services. These problems make it tough for local authorities to deliver effective, long-term solutions for their communities. Next generation government is already here Three months ago, I joined Nortal, a strategic innovation and technology company with a 20-year track-record of digitally transforming public services. Nortal started life in Estonia, a country that reimagined public services for its citizens after re-independence in 1991. Estonia posed the question: How can technology be best used for the benefit of citizens while driving economic growth? They were bold, prioritising some key enablers of democracy: investing in education, promoting citizen trust and providing transparency. Advocating for digital inclusion across generations and hard to reach communities encouraged strong citizen engagement and adoption. Today, 99% of Estonia’s government services are online. Nortal has been instrumental in creating 40% of those. The next phase of Estonia’s development is what Nortal calls personal government . This approach, which you can read about via the link, moves the focus towards public services becoming more proactive, personalised, and sustainable, so that life events trigger automatic support or early intervention tailored around individual need. I’ve been thinking about how some of these ideas might help address the challenges here in the UK, especially in response to impending budget and spending reviews ahead. Case study How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Joining the dots with technology and data One major issue in the UK is the fragmented nature of funding, where different services are funded separately, leading to inefficiencies. Personal government employs an integrated approach, where services are designed around the needs of the citizen rather than the structures of government. By pooling resources and focusing on outcomes that matter to people, we can create a more cohesive and effective public service system. In the UK, regional and place-based budgets are ideal testing grounds for this concept, and the following three areas could provide a good place to start: Proactive provision instead of short-term crisis management. Many government commentators talk of a “doom-loop” of short-term crisis management that prevents long-term planning. Personal government anticipates and addresses these needs before they become crises. This shift from reactive to proactive service delivery helps break the cycle of short-term fixes to enable long-term solutions. Designing services around the citizen to address a lack of coordination. Personal government creates a seamless experience by putting the citizen at the centre of service design. This means using technology so that all relevant services are interconnected, and citizens have a single point of access for all their needs. This approach can hide and join up the complexity of Government’s delivery organisation for the user. Empowerment and trust outweigh top-down efficiency. One size fits all initiatives often fail to produce real savings or improvements. By harnessing the capacity of a community to support its citizens, and better understanding of leading indicators to rising demand, we can better involve citizens in the design and delivery of services, the resulting system is not only more efficient, but it is more trusted and valued by the people it serves. As a starting point, personal government empowers citizens and builds trust through transparency and control over personal data. Are we ready for data driven innovation? The latest advances in AI highlight both the power and weakness of the underlying data it relies on. Once our data is properly prepared, we can harness algorithms and AI to enhance planning and decision-making, optimise service delivery, and improve public engagement. AI enables smarter planning by forecasting events and simulating decision impacts, ensuring that policies are effective and up to date. It automates routine tasks, manages service delivery more efficiently, and accurately predicts service demands. AI can also enhance public engagement by quickly analysing public sentiment or providing personalised responses, speeding up transactional enquiries while tailoring services to meet citizen and community needs. However, all these benefits depend on a solid foundation of data readiness. Data must be collected, cleansed, labelled, and integrated into a unified system. It must be secured to protect privacy and ensure compliance with regulations. Data must be handled ethically and without bias. In other words, data readiness builds trust both within an organisation and with external stakeholders. Case study Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Practical steps at the local level For these innovative approaches to be successful, having the right data infrastructure and governance is crucial for ensuring that solutions are effective, non-biased, ethical, safe, compliant, and secure. These can be implemented at a regional or local level. Nortal have developed their thinking into the 5 steps below in collaboration with its previous clients: Invest in data infrastructure . Local authorities need to invest in their data infrastructure so it can handle large volumes of data from diverse sources. Modernise legacy systems and adopt cloud-based solutions for scalability and accessibility. Build advanced data analytics expertise . Utilising tools like generative AI significantly enhances data quality and provides deeper insights. These technologies automate data cleansing and labelling processes and ensure accuracy and timeliness of data used for decision-making. Foster a data-driven culture . Encourage all levels of the organisation to embrace data-driven decision-making. Training staff on data literacy and providing them with the tools and resources they need to analyse and interpret data. Apply data governance, compliance and ethics . As data becomes more integral to public services, safeguarding it against breaches and misuse is paramount. Implementing stringent data privacy policies and security measures will help build trust with citizens. Promote policies and protections that share data for public good. Governments can enhance data sharing while protecting privacy by adopting technologies like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation. These tools enable data analysis without revealing personal information. Easier said than done While those five steps may seem straightforward, they can be challenging to implement. The process becomes smoother with the guidance of experienced professionals. At Nortal, we collaborate with visionary public sector leaders worldwide to simplify government processes, build trust, and enhance services for citizens.

    "title": "Smart search for Germany's procurement office",
    "content": "Home Insights An Intelligent Search for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community Article February 9, 2024 An Intelligent Search for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community Service Data and AI Experience and Design Modern Software Development Seamless Experiences Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Nortal created an AI-based proof of concept to tackle operational challenges in the procurement process by offering solutions to specific pain points. The intelligent search, as part of the Nortal Tark solution, aims to answer sustainability-related queries and identify relevant documents in the procurement context. The primary goal is to showcase how AI can enhance decision-making in a political context, while promoting transparency in an eGovernment setting. The proof of concept was successfully delivered, meeting all customer requirements, and ensuring data sovereignty for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community. Challenge The digitalization of procurement poses several challenges for the German public sector, including complex processes, tracking sustainability in procurements, and a significant documentation burden. The Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community produces hundreds of service descriptions for procurements each year, but the data within is largely untapped. This makes it difficult to evaluate procurement sustainability and use past procurements for strategic political decisions. Furthermore, it is crucial for procurers to have quick and easy access to existing information and documents to streamline their workflows efficiently. Addressing these issues is vital for enhancing transparency and efficiency in German public procurement. Solution The solution uses artificial intelligence to improve the creation of service descriptions in public procurement. Users are supported by the proof of concept AI text assistant, which uses an internal dataset of service descriptions and Sustainability documents and guidelines. The AI text assistant works in two stages. In the first stage, users ask questions and receive relevant text passages with a percentage indicating their similarity to the query. The second stage involves generating responses using the selected Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure accurate and contextual responses in natural language. The implemented solution “ Nortal Tark ” is generally LLM agnostic, meaning that any LLM can be used. The user interface design prioritises accessibility, user needs and confidence in AI answers. By emphasising task simplicity, the design streamlines complex processes. The minimalist interface minimises distractions and promotes a calm user experience. The solution is extensible to allow for flexible interactions, including multiple document formats and integration with platforms such as SharePoint or Confluence. It can operate in Q/A or chat mode, and the system highlights the exact snippet from which the answer is derived, ensuring transparency and accuracy. A second feature of the solution was to provide statistical information on the sustainability of a procurement. Sustainability notes contain critical sustainability information, but their accessibility is currently a challenge. These notes, completed during the procurement process, offer significant potential for comprehensive reporting and data-driven decisions in sustainable procurement. The sustainability statistics feature of Intelligent Search aims to make this data accessible and aggregated. The proof of concept provides initial analysis and visualisation for easy understanding and re-use. Result A reliable proof of concept was developed to meet the operational requirements of the Procurement Office, with a focus on data sovereignty. The AI-based solution utilises the power of a Large Language Model to address sustainability and efficiency issues in procurement. It provides optimisation and transparency by making relevant documents easily accessible, searchable, and reusable. The initiative aims to showcase the potential of AI in enhancing strategic decision-making in a policy context and promoting transparency in an eGovernment environment. Additionally, it aims to simplify the work of procurement officers by offering a practical and scalable solution. Contact us and find out how your organization can use AI efficiently and securely.

Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Watch the recording of the discussion with industry experts Andres Raieste , Senior Vice President of the Public Sector at Nortal, Mihkel Solvak , Associate Professor at the University of Tartu, and Ville Sirviö , CEO of the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions, as they dive deep into the future of public services, emphasizing the critical role of trust in digital services and exploring the future of interoperability from a global and whole-of-society perspective. Personal government is a vision that considers the next stage of already developed digital societies to provide more human-centric public services, considering the complexities where traditional digital government approaches do not necessarily provide a straightforward solution. Revolutionizing government: Turning the traditional view inside-out For the past several decades, the gradual adoption of new technologies in society and the digitalization of public services have allowed many nations to increase the efficiency and approval of public services. However, the maturity and impact of digitalization vastly differ based on the extent to which society has adopted new technologies and services in everyday life . The most significant differentiator in various maturity levels is how society has established trust in digital services and fostered high cooperation between authorities and citizens to build a robust data-based society and governance. In societies where the fundamentals of digital governance have been reasonably resolved, new types of services that cut across governance domains begin to emerge. Typically, these services do not have direct traditional analogs. The full realization of the possibilities of public services in the era of personal government requires the adoption of emerging technologies and the reorganization of the government’s working principles in terms of service provision and cooperation between institutions. Achieving high cooperation, enabled by interoperability and a whole-of-society approach to service delivery, is essential . All these capabilities are either well within today’s technological development or within reach and can be realized in the foreseeable future.

    "content": "Home Insights Research: Trust lacking in digital public services Article July 4, 2024 Research: Trust lacking in digital public services Thanks to consumer expectations driven by a world of one-click commerce, governments will eventually be required to embrace digital technologies in public services. There are of course obstacles to doing so, but they are not technology—the main barrier is trust. Read the report Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Government Transformation In brief Thanks to private-sector products and services offered by companies like Uber, DoorDash, Netflix, Amazon, and others, consumers have come to rely on and trust digital-only interactions with product- and service providers. Working with Censuswide, the London-based market research consultancy, 4,000 subjects in the UK and Canada were polled concerning their future expectations for digitally-based government services, the digital perception gap between private- and public-sector capabilities, as well as the amount of time they currently spend engaged getting government services. Respondents made it clear that they spend too much time obtaining healthcare, registering a car, or paying taxes. And they do expect governments to one day soon embrace digital technology in these public services. This finding was not surprising. However, the barriers identified were. While all respondents knew that technology offers a solution, few felt government could be trusted to offer it. Private companies, they felt, were more trustworthy. Read the report Since we live in a world where many interactions are only a click away, we wondered how people feel about the level of digitalization we are accustomed to from Uber or Amazon applied to healthcare, registering a car, or paying taxes. For the purposes of this research, digitalization was defined as never having to visit a physical office, with services are personalized to your needs and available to you when you need it with just a click of a button. Citizens expect government to go digital within two years Two in three citizens of the UK (66%) want to see the government deliver a fully digital suite of online public services, with an overwhelming majority (85%) wanting this shift to occur within the next two years. The vast majority of (70%) Canadians want fully digital public services, and 87% expect this within the next two years. But while the expectations are present, trust is not: Two thirds (66%) of UK citizens polled want fully online public digital services, but one-third (31%) do not trust the government to deliver them. Almost one-third of UK respondents (30%) said they are more likely to share personal data with private sector companies than the government for personalized services. 48% of all Canadians cite security and privacy concerns as their biggest fear in the shift to digital public services. Citizens want fully-digitized public services soon 85% of UK respondents want fully-digitalized public services within the next two years. 70% of Canadians demand fully digital public services, and 87% expect this by 2026. Problems currently take too long to resolve 29% of UK respondents believe issues take too long to resolve. UK respondents reported they spent on average a total of 12 hours engaging with government public services in the last year. The average Canadian spent 28 hours engaging with government services in the last year. Younger generations are more critical Generation Z (born 1997-2012) and Millennials are most critical of government services and need for more modern tech. In Canada, younger generations are most critical of government service, with 16% of Generation Z finding room for improvement. Citizens skeptical of government’s ability to deliver While 66% of Brits want fully-online public digital services, a full third (31%) are not convinced government can deliver. When it comes to personalized services, 30% of UK respondents say they are more likely to share personal data with private sector companies than the government. 48% of Canadian respondents cite security and privacy concerns as their biggest fear in the shift to digital public services. UK citizens and Canadians report being 10 times more likely to give their data in exchange for a Netflix recommendation, than for better benefits in a public service. Bridging the trust gap Nortal has been a part of building the most trusted governments in the world, we commissioned this study to better understand the environments in which we work. In an environment with many age groups and their differing expectations, we wanted to gain insight into how our customers can cater to the needs of the aging population while planning and creating services of the future. It is clear that governments have a mandate to offer public services in a digital format. But this study makes it clear that technology is not enough. The trust gap must be bridged at the same time.

    "title": "Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet",
    "content": "Home Insights Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet Article March 19, 2024 by Kertti Merimaa, VP of Healthcare (Estonia) Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet Personalized medicine is nothing new. Medical services have been enhanced by genomic testing since the end of the last century, but these services have been mostly regarded as exclusive or niche. But all of that is changing. Service Strategy and Transformation Industry Healthcare Nortal, together with partners in Estonia, has revolutionized the way we think of personalized medicine, creating a fully-operating infrastructure for Estonia, making it the first country ever to provide public, widely-scaled, genetic-powered medical services to its residents. A paradigm shift in healthcare Personalized medicine has brought an extra layer of precision and personalization to the medical care for many years, but has yet to be deployed in a wider scale. Imagine a healthcare system where every clinical pathway, treatment, every prescription is tailored to the unique genetic makeup of an individual. This is the promise of personalized medicine, a paradigm shift that has the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare on a global scale. At the forefront of this innovation is Estonia, a nation pioneering a new era in healthcare delivery through the integration of genomic data and cutting-edge technology. In Estonia, this vision is fast becoming a reality. In 2023, working with a host of partners, Nortal finished laying the foundations to provide large-scale, personalized medicine to Estonian residents. Thanks to new, pioneering healthcare policies and an empowering IT infrastructure, genetic information was connected harmoniously and safely to the healthcare ecosystem, enabling the seamless use of genomic powered algorithms in both prevention programs and everyday healthcare, such as the prescription of medication. Estonian Genome Centre is being entrusted with one of the highest coverage of genome data of population, implying that the people have the trust in nation to create health services that are truly precise and personalized. Genetics in everyday care The journey towards personalized medicine in Estonia is characterized by a forward-thinking approach to healthcare infrastructure. The creation of a nationwide IT framework, which is service-legislation agnostic, provides a robust platform for the delivery of a wide range of personalized medical services and an excellent testing ground for the development of new computing models. This ecosystem seamlessly connects biobanks, healthcare providers, national health records, and genetic algorithm computation services to automate the use of genetic algorithms in everyday care. An opt-in system by design, Estonians may easily manage consent to include their genetic data in the ecosystem, as well as order available genetic testing on the national patient portal. Alongside other personal health data, they may also manage genetic test results on the portal, and, if needed, book consultations with physicians. If citizens data is not yet included in the national biobank, they may do so by booking appointments at selected laboratories. Estonia’s computational environment for personalized medicine provides a unique platform to automate the calculation of a variety of genetic risks. Since the environment is safely connected to biobanks and the national heath record, algorithms run in the environment can use a wide array of health and environmental data, such as radiological imaging, diagnoses, and even lifestyle facts. The monitoring and management platform for genetic risk models offers a transparent overview and management of the growing number algorithms included to the platform, providing insights for algorithm creators for product improvement. Also, on this platform the results of the calculations are exported to the healthcare documentation form and sent to National Health Record. From there on, the documents are usable by healthcare providers and decision support systems. The personalized medicine management platform acts as the heart of the ecosystem. Hosted in the National Health Record, it helps keep track of consent, availability of data needed for calculations, and the status of each calculation, even automatically triggering an order for a calculation, if needed by a connected e-service. Doctors may order and see results of genetic tests through their local clinical systems, since rapid data exchange between health care provider systems and the national health record provides opportunity to seamlessly integrate the use of genetic algorithms in to clinical processes, minimizing extra steps. Results are also available on the national healthcare record’s doctors’ dashboard (also known as Data Viewer), a separate national information service for clinical doctors, to give optimal access to a patient’s health data in a user-friendly visual form. This sounds almost too good to be true, but Estonia has invested 20 years in interconnecting healthcare, using national technological building blocks such as the X-road for data exchange and ID numbers for unique patient identification. Since much of the groundwork was already present, it was easier to deploy new genetic-based functionalities in the ecosystem. Battling breast cancer and depression The first two services introduced in Estonia are a testament to the transformative potential of personalized medicine. A breast cancer screening program allows women to order genetic testing to assess their risk of developing breast cancer. If a risk is identified, individuals are included in the national screening program at a younger age, facilitating early detection and timely intervention. Similarly, the decision support system for prescribing antidepressants is poised to revolutionize mental healthcare in Estonia. By leveraging pharmacogenomic testing, doctors can make more informed decisions when prescribing antidepressants, leading to improved treatment outcomes and potentially life-saving interventions. Personalized medicine’s staggering potential The smart implementation of personalized medicine on a large scale can have a significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide. In an environment of soaring healthcare costs and a growing deficit of healthcare specialists, personalized medicine can help bring costs under control with better targeted care and a push for preventative care. Take, for example, the staggering healthcare costs associated with depression. The economic burden of major depressive disorder among U.S. adults only has been estimated to be in hundreds of billions, from treatment costs to indirect costs to the society, caused by the sufferer’s inability to work and function in everyday life. Costs may be reduced by improving the effectiveness of treatment, thus increasing the number of patients who achieve remission. Antidepressants are the first line of treatment, though more than half of patients do not respond to treatment on the first try, and even fewer achieve remission. This results in trial-and-error regimens that lead to treatment failures and side effects of medication. By using pharmacogenetic testing, it is estimated that, in Estonia, the gains are for each life-year gained amount to 30,000 to 50,000 euros saved on healthcare costs. Prescribing an effective medicine on the first try produces results on many levels. In addition to better targeted care, personalized medicine offers opportunities for prevention and early detection. Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in Estonian women. According to current statistics, every 14th woman will get breast cancer during her lifetime. Each year, approximately 800 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, with 38 percent suffering from a spread to lymph nodes or neighboring organs at the time of detection, and 10 percent with a tumor with distant metastases — that is, a poor prognosis due to spread. If the cancer can be detected earlier, the prognosis would be much better. For women under 40 (around 20 percent of cases), it is believed that cancer traced to monogenic predisposition is more prevalent, thus it may be concluded that genome-based screening may prove useful for early detection. The value proposition of personalized medicine lies in its ability to deliver the right help to people at the right time. Whether with the treatment of cancer, depression, heart disease, or any other number of conditions, personalized medicine offers a targeted approach to healthcare that can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Policy is a precondition Despite its obvious benefits, the journey towards personalized medicine is not without its challenges. The healthcare domain is exceptionally sensitive and sophisticated, and the implementation of personalized medical services means careful navigation, as well as legislative- and policy decisions. Nortal believes that carefully developed service models and clear regulation, accompanied by technology as an enabler, permit big things to happen. In the case of implementing personalized medicine in Estonia, Nortal participated in the entire process, from the business analysis of service models to the technical development of IT infrastructure. This participation in the full service creation lifecycle ensures that agreements and technology go hand in hand, enabling one another, instead of holding the other back. Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery, offering tailored solutions that promise to revolutionize patient care. Estonia’s pioneering efforts serve as a blueprint for nations around the world, demonstrating the transformative potential of integrating genomics and technology into healthcare delivery. As we look toward the future, personalized medicine offers a glimpse of a world where healthcare can be truly precise and personalized.

    "content": "Home Insights Moving healthcare to the cloud Case study March 7, 2024 Moving healthcare to the cloud Service Cloud Transformation Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Healthcare Nortal built a Microsoft Azure cloud environment for Finland’s Kanta-Häme county that allows multiple IT vendors to develop services independently with shared underlying infrastructure and governance. Orders from above In 2021, Finland’s government passed social and healthcare reform legislation making the organization of health, social, and emergency services the responsibility of 21 “Wellbeing” counties in Finland. The reform was designed to ensure equality of service to end users while controlling cost growth. Kanta-Häme county in Southern Finland was designated one of these Wellbeing counties, requiring it to take control of services previously offered by 11 different municipalities. “This was the largest reform in recent memory in Finland,” says Jarkko Enden , CTO at Nortal Finland. “The work force was moved from city- to county level, and an entirely new organization was created. The reform created enormous pressure, since the counties now had to do more with less money.” – Harri Halinen, Development Manager, IT, Kanta-Häme well-being county As we embark on harnessing cloud technologies in our well-being county, our collaboration with Nortal and their experts has proven exceptionally pleasant and fruitful. An atmosphere of trust To do more with less required a modern, cloud-based solution, though that in no way was as simple as it may sound. The default “lift and shift” approach moves legacy systems to the cloud as they are, but there are several problems with this. “Some think lift and shift will introduce cost savings, but many find out there aren’t automatic benefits,” says Enden. “It can even cost you more if you don’t do it properly.” A second issue was that the platform needed to allow new applications to be built by a variety of independent vendors who would employ cutting-edge technology for new services, slowly allowing the strangulation of legacy systems. For example, legacy systems like finance, HR, and patient record systems will eventually be moved to the cloud, yet the platform also needs to allow for modernization like enabling video calls with customers, and the history of patient data stored in different systems needs to be easily accessible by customer support personnel. The project’s second phase established a centralized API management solution within the newly created environment, allowing for data to be published and stored in a controlled and secure manner via APIs. The APIs can be made accessible within the internal environment or even from the public internet – connecting on-premise systems to the cloud. For example, the Oma-Häme app, Kanta-Häme’s on-demand doctor service, leverages the new API layer to connect existing services and data sources directly to the application. This allows development to focus on building for the end-user, by ensuring the backend architecture is done right. Kanta-Häme turned to Nortal to build this most important part of its cloud transformation journey. Nortal had Anssi Pannula and Tuomo Hokkanen , two Cloud Architects with long Microsoft histories and Azure certifications. Although Nortal has many Microsoft experts, they also have a reputation for being cloud agnostic. “We’re often more in the role of consultants,” says Enden. – Jarkko Enden, CTO at Nortal Finland We use Google and Amazon, as well, but since we don't sell our own products, we're known for not trying to sell licenses and things customers don’t need or won’t use. That allows us to build real trust with our clients. Constant innovation While their cloud environment and its governance models will constantly evolve, the benefits are already apparent. The shared underlying infrastructure allows for the construction of innovative features by dozens of vendors, in a matter of hours instead of weeks. Security is ensured, privacy guaranteed, and performance enhanced without adding costs. It is far from complete — and, by design, never will be. “Pace-layered architecture recognizes that different parts of an organization’s IT landscape change at different rates,” says Enden. “The system we created is a place where Kanta-Häme will build and build and keep on building. It allows for constant innovation.” – Harri Halinen, Development Manager, IT, Kanta-Häme well-being county The true value of expertise shines through, especially in tackling intricate technological challenges. A seasoned expert often finds solutions effortlessly, quickly and in cost effective way.

    "content": "Case study August 28, 2023 A hospital information system for smoother workflows and better care Service Data and AI Seamless Experiences Industry Healthcare Nortal is building a Hospital Information System (HIS) with the objective to improve workflows for doctors and nurses, and therefore help them deliver better care to patients. This case study is based on the HIS implementation within Tartu University Hospital and all its subsidiaries in southern Estonia and Viljandi hospital. Challenge With health data becoming increasingly digitized, doctors are spending more time entering data on their computers and less time interacting with patients. The software systems adopted by hospitals are often clunky, with staff becoming increasingly frustrated and reluctant towards embracing new sets of fragmented technologies. Solution: Smooth communication between all health systems We created The Hospital Information System to cover all processes within the hospital, while also enabling smooth communication with other information systems is Healthcare (such as the National Health Record). HIS makes sure that the patient’s journey is thoroughly recorded from the moment they contact the hospital to book a visit to the moment a bill is received after being discharged. Within the hospital, a central process-driven solution unifies and simplifies the complex diagnostic and healthcare processes for staff in order to help them provide patients with high-quality medical services even more effectively. Impact: Delivering better care to patients The Hospital Information System has significantly reduced the administrative workload of hospital staff, enabling the clinical personnel to focus more on the actual diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly – the patient. The Patient Portal allows patients to access their medical data more conveniently while giving them the ability to engage with the medical process transparently from the get-go.

    "title": "2025: The year cybersecurity rules rewrite U.S. healthcare",
    "content": "Home Insights 2025: The year cybersecurity rules rewrite U.S. healthcare Article January 6, 2025 by Liz Kiehner, Chief Growth Officer of North America, Nortal 2025: The year cybersecurity rules rewrite U.S. healthcare The U.S. healthcare industry is entering 2025 under the spotlight of heightened cybersecurity threats and evolving regulatory landscapes. In response to the growing number of cyberattacks targeting sensitive patient data and critical infrastructure, new cybersecurity regulations are being introduced at both federal and state levels. These measures aim to enhance the resilience of healthcare organizations and protect patient privacy. Service Cyber Resilience Industry Healthcare Industry Key regulatory changes impacting the healthcare sector in 2025 1. Health Infrastructure Security and Accountability Act (HISAA) Proposed by Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Warner, HISAA introduces minimum cybersecurity standards for healthcare organizations, including hospitals and health plans. Key requirements: annual security audits, improved threat detection, and enhanced technical safeguards. Federal funding will help smaller providers meet these standards. Currently under Senate review, HISAA could be enacted by 2025. 2. New York State Department of Health Cybersecurity Regulations Starting January 1, 2025, New York hospitals must implement comprehensive cybersecurity programs, conduct regular risk assessments, and promptly report incidents. These measures aim to protect patient data and maintain healthcare services during cyberattacks. Non-compliance could lead to penalties and reputational harm. 3. California Assembly Bill 749 Effective 2025, AB 749 mandates a zero-trust architecture for healthcare, emphasizing micro-segmentation for medical devices and clinical networks. Quarterly assessments will ensure effectiveness and prevent attackers from exploiting weak links. This law addresses the rising vulnerabilities of interconnected medical systems. 4. Updates to the HIPAA Security Rule The updated HIPAA Security Rule requires network segmentation to prevent unauthorized lateral movement in systems with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). These enhancements target modern threats like ransomware and advanced persistent threats, ensuring healthcare organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber risks. Implications for healthcare organizations To comply with these new regulations, healthcare organizations must: Establish a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Program: Ensure policies, procedures, and governance structures align with evolving regulations, providing a solid foundation for all security efforts. Conduct Ongoing Risk Assessments: Regularly evaluate vulnerabilities, threats, and potential compliance gaps. Use these assessments to continuously refine a cybersecurity program. Implement a Zero-Trust Architecture: Incorporate elements such as micro-segmentation, network segmentation for ePHI, and continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorized lateral movement and strengthen overall network defenses. Build a Cyber-Aware Workforce: Provide robust training and education programs that equip employees with the knowledge to recognize threats, follow best practices, and effectively utilize security tools. While these regulations introduce new compliance responsibilities and operational burdens, they also present a critical opportunity to enhance overall resilience and strengthen trust in healthcare delivery. By going beyond mere box-ticking exercises and investing in meaningful improvements—such as advanced threat detection, zero-trust architectures, and robust employee training — organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to cyber risks. Conversely, viewing these new rules solely as compliance hurdles risks leaving valuable security potential on the table, ultimately increasing vulnerability and undermining patient confidence. In other words, embracing these regulations not just as mandates, but as a catalyst for long-term cybersecurity maturity, can pay dividends in both patient trust and organizational stability. As the healthcare industry navigates these new regulatory landscapes, partnering with experts in digital transformation and cybersecurity is crucial. Nortal, with its proven track record in creating world-leading national health record systems in Estonia, Finland, and Lithuania, and its extensive experience working with U.S. healthcare organizations, is uniquely positioned to help meet these challenges.

Background and challenges A southern-based healthcare provider faced significant challenges due to a large volume of scattered and siloed vulnerability and risk information. Multiple individual vulnerability identification and prevention tracks were in progress, but there was no clear overview of the all existing gaps, neither unified tactical and strategic plans for action present. This current state in the context of recent wide-impact attacks on healthcare providers posed a significant concern within the client. Nortal was requested to conduct an objective current-state assessment to develop a prioritized roadmap for the organization’s cybersecurity strategy and actions to follow. Approach To address the challenges that this organization faced, Nortal employed the following strategies: Analysis of existing information: Nortal analyzed the existing vulnerability and risk information already in possession by the healthcare provider. External OSINT reconnaissance: Conducted external Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance to gain a broader perspective on potential threats. Activities included identification of existing vulnerabilities within publicly available assets, research for leaked information available in the dark web as well as mapping of most active threat actor groups and common vectors of attack within the health domain. Risk landscape definition: Defined the overall risk landscape for the company, considering various internal and external factors. Business context and value mapping: Mapped the business context and value to vulnerable assets to establish a clear foundation for prioritizing efforts and estimating the required resources. Mapping existing initiatives: Mapped current enhancement initiatives to vulnerabilities and priority areas to ensure alignment with the new strategy. Outcome Identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities and gaps: The most significant vulnerabilities, gaps and vulnerability clusters were identified and prioritized, focusing on those posing the highest risk. Actionable recommendations: Specific recommendations for actions were defined and prioritized based on estimated risk impact and time to value and were categorized into urgent actions, tactical actions, strategic actions. Strategic roadmaps: The strategic roadmaps for implementation were created that included existing enhancement initiatives and additionally recommended actions addressing all high and medium risk vulnerabilities and well as increasing overall organizational cybersecurity posture and resilience. Incident response preparation: Incident response scenarios were prepared for tabletop exercises, emphasizing the identified gaps and the overall risk landscape.

    "content": "Case study June 22, 2023 Space resource management in active use in Satakunta Optimizing the number of rooms in hospital facilities is a complex challenge, trying to solve issues like what kind of reception room a surgical procedure needs or the optimal space for a psychiatric admission. In its complexity, optimizing admission spaces in well-being services counties is perhaps one of the biggest challenges of the public sector’s facility management. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Healthcare Together with our customer 2M-IT, we have developed an agile solution for booking and optimizing hospital reception rooms called the Space Resource Management solution. Developed on Microsoft’s low-code Power Platform, this solution enables public administrations and services to efficiently manage and optimize the use of facilities. Challenge It is common for public administrations and services to be full of inefficient processes, routines, and manual steps that slow down customer and patient service and frustrate the already overburdened staff. For example, in older hospitals in well-being services counties, the average occupancy rate of outpatient clinic rooms is as low as 20%. In practice, an admission room can be empty up to four out of five working days a week. If the occupancy rate was closer to the target of 70%, the well-being services counties could invest the money they save on rent, heating, lighting, and building maintenance in patient care instead. Background The main objective of developing this solution was to ensure that even though professionals no longer have their own offices, there’s always a space available for all professionals and each appointment. Background work At the beginning of the project, the cornerstones of the customer’s operations were defined: what kind of services are being provided; how many rooms are available for use, e.g., in the entire hospital or in one of its outpatient clinics; the total number of professionals working on the premises; and which space is suitable for which service. In addition to the basic parameters, a myriad of different customer-specific rules can be defined for the solution. For example, we defined a “two-and-a-half-hour rule,” which means that if a professional has at least two appointments during a 2.5-hour period, these appointments will occur in the same room. This means that the professional does not have to leave the room between appointments, provided the available space is suitable for both appointments. The application’s optimization algorithm was developed in collaboration with the customer. The customer decided on the prioritization order of the requirements, and we translated the requirements into technology. For example, it can take into account that the busiest doctors with consecutive appointments should be able to stay in the same room for as long as possible. Professionals with more sporadic appointments can move from one room to another between their appointments – but even in these cases, it is prioritized, e.g., that these rooms are located on the same floor. This is all based on the requirements of the appointments, e.g., in terms of equipment needed for a procedure. Solution In hospitals, outpatient appointments are usually booked well in advance. The now-developed space resource management solution optimizes reservations for available rooms only the day before the appointment. This ensures that each appointment is allocated the most suitable space, considering the different requirements of the various reception services, thus ensuring efficient use of space and minimizing last-minute changes. We developed the solution piece-by-piece from small parts and used agile software development methodologies. We wanted to change the end users’ and our customers’ roles from buyers to active developers by involving from the beginning in design and development from the beginning. Cloud technology at the base of the application ensures that development is modern and scalable. – Anssi Luoma, Project Director of the Satasairaala Hospital Renewal project Without the pilot, such a space resource management solution for a hospital environment could not be developed and deployed, and the collaboration with 2M-IT and Nortal has been very close. Impact The newly developed space resource management solution will benefit any well-being services county that wants to improve the efficiency of its facilities. For example, in Satakunta, a new hospital building was commissioned in 2023, where professionals no longer have their own offices; instead, the space resource management solution has been implemented. The scale of economic savings that this change will achieve is illustrated by the fact that if all professionals still had their own offices, the new hospital building would have to be three times bigger than it is now. The key benefits of this solution include not only the automatic optimization of space and transparency of room reservations but also the ability to start forecasting and optimizing space for the future. As the system accumulates historical data on the service demands, future needs can be anticipated.

    "content": "Home Insights Estonian Air Force utilizes AI to enhance Air Raid Warning System Case study August 29, 2024 Estonian Air Force utilizes AI to enhance Air Raid Warning System The Estonian Air Force is a service branch of the Estonian Defense Forces. Since its re-establishment in 1994, the Estonian Air Force has been built up from scratch by a generation of relatively young airmen who embrace constant change and technological advances. The Estonian Air Force is designed to cooperate with NATO Air Forces and is optimistic about the future, which will bring a steady increase in operational capabilities across all fields of development. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Challenge Amid some uncertainty in regional geopolitical conditions the Estonian Air Force, inspired by the Ukraine counterparts, has started its own programs for developing AI-assisted solutions involving Estonia-based IT companies to develop the solutions. One of the recently revealed features of this program is implementing an AI-powered air threat identification system within the “Be Ready” mobile application – an Estonian Defense League’s application for increasing general population’s resilience by providing instructions for various crisis management situations etc. The recently developed AI assisted air threat detection solution integrated into this app enhances the national Air Raid Warning system by incorporating inputs from mobile phones of the participating citizens. The primary objective of this AI solution is to enhance the Estonian Air Force’s air threat detection capabilities, specifically on lower altitudes by incorporating citizen generated mobile phone-based reporting. This function in the app allows users to report air threats or suspicious air activities using their mobile phones, enabling the Air Force to receive actionable intelligence on air activities quickly and efficiently. Solution The AI-powered aircraft identification feature integrated into the app combines mobile phone technology with AI capabilities. Mobile application “Be Ready” enabled citizens quickly and easily capture photos of suspicious activities in the airspace and forward them to a server for further analysis by AI, followed by display in an Air Forces Air Operations Center. The debut of this capability was successfully tested during the Estonian largest annual joint military exercise – Spring Storm 2024. AI solution: AI processes the input, merging information from multiple users across a wider geographical area to compile a concise real-time report for the Air Force. This automated assessment includes among others the location of the report and the current and projected location of the reported object. In addition to real-time data and future projection, historical data can also be viewed for aiding in military decision-making. Results Usability and user experience Users can quickly open the app, point their phones at suspicious objects in the air and take a photo, submit their report, which includes the photo and additional information, through the AI server to the Air Force with a single tap. The app provides feedback to users, acknowledging the receipt of their report and thanking them for their valuable contribution. Operational impact and security The AI-enhanced “Be Ready” app significantly bolsters National security by enabling citizens to report any suspicious air activity in their vicinity. In emergency situations, the Air Force benefits from having additional “eyes” across the country, supported by AI that interprets objects type, locations, and other crucial information. Launch and implementation The AI solution for the app was launched during Estonia’s Defense Forces Spring Storm exercise on May 10, 2024. This military exercise served as a large-scale testbed for the implementation phase, where the app and its integrated AI features were stress-tested and thoroughly evaluated for effectiveness. Population engagement By involving the community, the Estonian Air Force enhances its air surveillance capabilities, promotes a sense of shared responsibility and vigilance among the populace. Actively engaged civilians add an extra layer to the security carpet and can become a crucial source of information in case of (however unlikely) conflict escalation. Possible next steps The AI-powered aircraft identification feature Keep integrating more sensors into the system to maintain and even enhance air surveillance capabilities at the lower altitudes. This is especially useful if military radars are on the move or otherwise temporarily unavailable. Create multiple layers of AI-processed information for different command levels and play with combining different data feeds and data points into a Combined Operating Picture. Add sound and image recognition to ensure automatic identification of aircraft and drones even at night or in case of poor weather conditions. – Estonian Air Force Exceptionally smooth cooperation with Nortal engineers ensured a rapid Nation-wide launch of the well-functioning prototype. Having eyes on the ground as well as in the air is a standard in a state-on-state military confrontation but poses a threat of soldiers becoming overwhelmed by inflow of information. As we incorporate AI for information processing we will gain more time for the commander’s decision making and that already is a tangible advantage. Conclusion The AI-powered air threat identification solution is a demonstration of the Estonia’s receptiveness to innovation. By creating a platform for citizen engagement and utilizing AI to process and relay information, the Estonian Air Force has significantly strengthened its ability to monitor and respond to threats in our airspace. This initiative promptly highlights the potential of AI-driven solutions in enhancing security and promoting community involvement in the National defense framework. The Estonian Defense Forces goal is to enhance the overall resilience of Estonia’s residents and enable the Air Force to create a comprehensive air picture that includes civilian reporting integrated with the more traditional radar picture.

    "content": "Article April 15, 2025 by Ivo Pure, Lead Architect at Nortal Ensuring operational continuity through resilient swarming Service Cyber Force Protection Technology and Engineering Industry Defence Cyber Resilience Swarming Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UASs) are revolutionizing military operations. Unlike traditional autonomous units that act independently, these advanced systems—ranging from aerial drones to unmanned ground and maritime vehicles—operate as a highly coordinated, self-organising network. By leveraging decentralised communication, real-time situational awareness, and human-out-of-the-loop decision-making, swarming UASs can execute missions with unparalleled speed, adaptability, and efficiency across air, land, sea, and cyber domains. However, as these systems become more autonomous, ensuring cybersecurity and resilience against adversarial threats and system vulnerabilities is more critical than ever. Advanced security solutions are essential to safeguard these networks and mitigate vulnerabilities. Key components of swarm operations The effectiveness of swarming UASs depends on the seamless integration of communication systems and autonomy modules that enable continuous, real-time collaboration. Communication systems establish a secure data exchange framework, allowing units to share intelligence, mission updates, and adaptive operational strategies. These systems must function even under electronic warfare threats, such as jamming and interference. Autonomy modules use situational-based AI and machine learning to drive independent decision-making, enhance situational awareness, and enable self-organisation in complex and unpredictable mission environments. Each unit is also equipped with Distributed detection systems , which enable localized threat monitoring and autonomous countermeasures. This reduces reliance on centralised command structures, enhancing operational flexibility. Centralised coordination mechanisms , meanwhile, provide a Global View of Operations during mission execution. This allows human operators to oversee swarm dynamics, issue high-level directives, and intervene as necessary. In environments where GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) dependency presents a critical vulnerability, multi-layered navigation systems offer redundancy. These systems combine onboard sensor fusion, terrain-based navigation, and adaptive localisation techniques to ensure continued operational effectiveness. Cyber security challenges Despite their operational advantages, swarming UAS face a range of cybersecurity and operational challenges that threaten mission effectiveness. Vulnerabilities to Electronic Warfare (EW) Attacks. The reliance on real-time communication introduces weaknesses to RF jamming, signal interception, and GNSS spoofing, which adversaries can use to disrupt coordination and misdirect units. Expanded Attack Surface. Due to the distributed nature of swarm architectures, the overall attack surface grows significantly. A single compromised unit can serve as a point of entry, allowing adversaries to infiltrate or degrade the entire swarm. Challenges to Autonomous Decision-Making. Autonomous decision-making in adversarial environments complicates resilience efforts. AI-driven autonomy is vulnerable to data poisoning, adversarial manipulation, and sensor-based deception, leading to suboptimal mission execution or potential system failure. Need for Robust Data Validation and Integrity. Multi-agent systems require finely tuned data validation and integrity mechanisms to prevent erroneous information from spreading throughout the swarm, which could compromise collective decision-making processes. Addressing these challenges requires an advanced cybersecurity framework integrating adaptive threat detection, self-healing response mechanisms, and secure swarm-wide coordination protocols to ensure operational continuity in highly contested battlespaces. Article Unmanned ground systems are the backbone of modern defence Building resilience in next-generation swarming Ensuring resilience in next-generation swarming UAS operations requires a combination of autonomous adaptation, robust communication, and intelligent navigation. A resilient swarm must be capable of maintaining operational effectiveness under cyber threats, electronic warfare (EW) disruptions, and environmental challenges. Autonomous Adaptation & Threat Mitigation Adaptive Monitoring Systems: Continuous monitoring of UAS behavior is achieved through distributed anomaly detection mechanisms. These systems assess deviations in communication integrity, movement path consistency, and sensor data accuracy by cross-referencing inputs from multiple swarm units. This redundancy-based validation ensures that anomalies such as spoofing attempts, navigation drift, or sensor degradation are identified before they compromise mission effectiveness. Detected irregularities trigger automated mitigation protocols, including autonomous recalibration of affected subsystems or dynamic reallocation of mission roles to unaffected units. Self-Healing Mechanisms: Autonomous self-recovery protocols enable units to reconfigure formations, redistribute tasks, and restore network integrity in response to compromised or lost nodes. Secure Communication & Coordination Decentralised Consensus Protocols: Swarm units employ distributed trust mechanisms to validate mission-critical data and ensure resilience against cyber manipulation. Encrypted, Redundant Data Channels: Multi-layered encryption and frequency-hopping communication mitigate EW attacks, jamming, and signal interception. Mission-Aware Coordination: AI-enhanced mission control dynamically issues high-level directives while swarm units execute decentralised decision-making, ensuring operational flexibility. Multi-Layered Navigation & GNSS Independence Sensor Fusion & Terrain-Based Navigation: Integrating LIDAR, computer vision, and inertial navigation systems (INS) allows the swarm to maneuver effectively in GPS-denied environments. Cognitive Environmental Mapping: Real-time environmental learning enables the swarm to detect, classify, and adapt to dynamic obstacles and adversarial conditions. Together, these solutions reinforce the swarm’s self-sufficiency, adaptability, and security, ensuring continued effectiveness in highly adversarial conditions. Advancing secure autonomous swarming We at Nortal Defence have developed a comprehensive, modular solution to enhance the resilience of swarming UASs in contested environments. By integrating adaptive monitoring, autonomous threat mitigation, and AI-driven intelligence, we ensure that these systems can operate securely, even in complex, high-risk operational theatres. With dynamic threat monitoring, self-recovery capabilities, and secure communication, we help swarming UASs maintain mission integrity under cyber threats. The balance between directive-based centralised oversight and decentralised autonomy ensures scalability, agility, and long-term survivability, allowing these systems to self-adapt, neutralise emerging threats, and operate confidently in rapidly evolving mission environments. As autonomous warfare evolves, securing swarming UAS operations remains critical. Our expertise in resilient multi-agent autonomy, cyber defence, and mission-critical AI systems underpins the foundation for next-generation distributed warfare, enabling military forces to deploy secure, adaptable, and highly effective swarming UASs in the face of modern threats.

    "title": "Cyber resilience in action: Why cyber exercising is the key to surviving digital threats",
    "content": "Article May 23, 2025 by Peter Leinberg, Head of Exercise Planning and Delivery Cyber resilience in action: Why cyber exercising is the key to surviving digital threats Explore different exercises Service Cyber Resilience Industry Energy and Resources Strategy and Transformation Despite increasing investments in security tools, many organisations still struggle with cyber resilience. Why? Because technology alone cannot solve the problem – people are often the weakest link , and without proper preparation, even the most advanced defences can crumble. This coin has two sides; however – cyber exercises transform the weakest link into cybersecurity’s most valuable asset. The urgency of cyber resilience Cyber threats are escalating at an alarming rate. In 2023 alone, global cybercrime costs reached €7 trillion , with forecasts predicting a rise to over € 9 trillion in 2025 . Ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and supply chain attacks have become daily occurrences, targeting businesses, governments, and critical infrastructure alike. Organisations must recognise that cyber threats are not just an IT problem – they are an existential risk that can disable operations, damage reputations, and result in severe financial losses. As a result of a ransomware attack in April 2025, the British retailer Marks & Spencer lost about £ 60M ( €71M) in revenue due to having to suspend online sales, its stock price fell more than 15%, wiping billions off its market capitalisation, and customer loyalty dwindled after learning that some customer data was also stolen during the attack. Healthcare institutions have seen ransomware attacks delay life-saving procedures; manufacturing plants have suffered production halts due to operational technology (OT) breaches, and financial institutions have faced crippling fraud incidents. The infamous 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack , which led to widespread fuel shortages across the U.S., is a stark reminder of how cyber incidents can disrupt entire economies. In this high-stakes landscape, cyber resilience is no longer optional – it’s a necessity . Resilience means being able to anticipate, withstand, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents with minimal disruption. It ensures that businesses can continue to operate despite attacks, mitigating damage and maintaining stakeholder trust. To achieve cyber resilience, organisations must create an ecosystem that integrates continuous employee training and realistic cyber exercises, along with clear governance, proactive risk management, and robust cybersecurity tools. This approach builds preparedness, ensures swift incident response, and maintains operational stability even in the face of sophisticated threats. Explore different exercises The human factor: The Achilles’ heel of cybersecurity Studies show that 82% of cyber breaches involve human error . Whether it’s an employee falling for a phishing email, using weak passwords, or misconfiguring cloud storage, the human element remains a top security vulnerability. Organisations invest billions in cybersecurity yet often overlook the simplest defence mechanism: education and preparedness. There is a reason why a British Army adage dating back to World War II is still used and relevant, highlighting the importance of training before action. The 7Ps – Prior Planning and Preparation Prevent Piss Poor Performance. Beyond unintentional mistakes, social engineering attacks exploit human psychology , making even the most security-aware individuals susceptible to manipulation. Recently, Microsoft’s Regional Director, security researcher, and consultant, Troy Hunt, shared how he fell for a phishing attack . Attackers exploit trust, urgency, and authority to deceive employees into handing over credentials, transferring funds, or granting access to sensitive systems. One of the most common forms of social engineering, phishing messages have skyrocketed by 4,151% since the advent of ChatGPT in 2022. The consequences of human error are costly. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report , businesses lose an average of €3.9 million per breach , with phishing and stolen credentials being the top initial attack vectors. Furthermore, 60% of small and medium-sized businesses go out of business within six months of experiencing a cyberattack. But here’s the paradox – while human error is the cause of most cyber incidents, humans are also the solution. A well-trained workforce can act as a human firewall, detecting anomalies, responding to threats efficiently, and preventing incidents before they escalate. Employees may be the weakest link, but they are also the first line of defence and, potentially, when educated, our greatest cyber defence asset. Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue – it’s a cultural one. A strong security culture ensures that cyber awareness becomes second nature, integral to everyday operations. A strong security culture also relies on another cultural choice, one that values and champions continuous education. When coupled with leadership buy-in and reinforced through realistic cyber exercises, these aspects of a mature, agile organisation set the foundation for resilience that can ensure operational success regardless of the threat or environment. Cyber exercising: The cornerstone of cyber resilience Cyber exercises must be integrated into our security strategy to truly strengthen cyber resilience. These structured simulations test an organisation’s readiness against real-world cyber threats. They help teams practice incident response, refine decision-making processes, clarify communications channels, assure roles and responsibilities, test assumptions, hone tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and build confidence in crises. From critical infrastructure to corporate enterprises, cyber exercising equips teams with the practical experience to respond with clarity and speed. Whether defending national infrastructure or safeguarding sensitive customer data, these exercises transform static response plans into living capabilities. Cyber exercising goes beyond routine cybersecurity awareness training. While annual training sessions and e-learning modules provide foundational knowledge, they often fail to prepare employees for high-pressure, real-world attacks. Research from Cornell University highlights that experiential learning – engaging multiple senses through real-world challenges – significantly enhances knowledge retention and engagement. The study notes that while people generally remember 10% of what they read and 20% of what they hear, retention rates can reach as high as 75% when all senses are engaged in hands-on experiences. Cyber exercises create an immersive, hands-on experience where participants actively respond to evolving threats. This dynamic approach fosters muscle memory, ensuring that teams react swiftly and effectively when faced with a real cyber crisis, as they become intimately familiar with processes that they would otherwise only use in an actual incident. The more tailored the scenarios, the greater the impact. Generic, one-size-fits-all exercises may offer surface-level value. Still, they often fail to expose the real vulnerabilities or test the actual decision-making dynamics unique to a specific organisation. Truly effective cyber exercises must be context-driven, designed around the systems, processes, people, and risks that define your operational reality. This approach ensures that participants don’t just go through the motions – they experience realistic dilemmas, respond to plausible threats, and see the direct implications of their actions on critical assets. It builds credible muscle memory and reveals how your actual infrastructure and teams perform under duress. In addition to tailoring, there are three core elements that we believe should be part of every effective cyber exercise experience: Cross-functional involvement Simulations beyond IT teams, connecting all relevant stakeholders from across the organisation and their supply chain, ensure we capture a holistic image of an organisation’s resilience posture and preparedness for breach. Realistic threat simulations Employing the latest Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that real-world threat actors use ensures the training is relevant and impactful. Measurable outcomes Post-exercise assessments provide actionable insights at every level, helping organisations continuously improve their security posture. Why cyber exercising matters Reveals critical gaps in technical controls, escalation paths, and decision-making workflows. Fosters organisation-wide collaboration, improving coordination and communication across all roles, functions, and levels. Builds confidence under pressure, giving participants, groups, and organisations muscle memory they can rely on. Exposes participants to real-world attack techniques, improving detection, containment, and familiarity. Strengthens regulatory and stakeholder alignment by stress-testing notification and reporting procedures in a simulated environment. Fosters a culture of continuous improvement by turning lessons from exercises into actionable changes across people, processes, and technologies. There are different ways to test your defences Cybersecurity exercises are vital for preparing organisations against cyber threats, primarily split into tabletop and operations-based types. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based, where teams role-play hypothetical scenarios, such as ransomware, to refine response plans and improve coordination without impacting real systems. Operations-based exercises are hands-on simulations of real incidents, testing practical response skills and operational readiness under pressure. Individually, tabletop exercises enhance strategic planning and communication, while operations-based ones build technical proficiency. Together in a Test, Training, and Exercise (TT&E) program, they form a comprehensive preparedness framework that combines planning with practical testing to bolster overall cyber defence. Tabletop exercises: Strengthening communication and crisis readiness Tabletop exercises are critical for refining crisis response in a controlled, low-risk environment. In our recent tabletop exercise with a large organisation’s communications team, we facilitated a scenario-driven exercise that simulated a cyber incident unfolding in real-time. The goal: to evaluate communication flows, stress-test decision-making, and prepare the team for the pressures of a live cyber crisis. The exercise revealed key insights: Crisis coordination mechanisms require refinement to ensure seamless collaboration among internal stakeholders and external partners during rapidly evolving incidents. Decision-making under pressure remains a challenge, underscoring the need for more regular, scenario-based training to build confidence in high-stakes situations. Strong internal relationships are a resilience multiplier, enabling faster alignment and more cohesive communication in moments of uncertainty. Third-party coordination protocols need to be formalised, particularly in managing external investigative teams and vendors during an incident lifecycle. Single points of failure can manifest as a result of churn, rapid growth, untested assumptions, and any number of other causes; regardless, they significantly negatively impact resilience when triggered. These findings drove targeted improvements across communication workflows, escalation protocols, and stakeholder engagement strategies, sharpening the team’s ability to communicate effectively and own the narrative during future cyber events. These outcomes are exactly what tabletop exercises are designed to produce: clear, actionable improvements in team performance and process maturity. Operational exercises: Real-world attack simulations For cybersecurity and IT teams, technical hands-on exercises provide an immersive, real-time experience in responding to cyberattacks. These simulations replicate real-world threats, allowing defenders to detect, mitigate, and recover from incidents. During one of our recent national cyber exercises, participants engaged in a highly realistic, live-fire environment that closely mirrored the intensity and complexity of a real-world cyberattack on critical national infrastructure. Leveraging federated cyber ranges and connected industrial control system environments, the exercise enabled cross-functional teams – including Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) and Central Security Operations Centre (CSOC) staff – to practice identifying, containing, and recovering from sustained and multi-layered attacks. Participants were challenged to manage incidents in real-time, make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information, and maintain situational awareness under pressure – all while sustaining operational continuity. Key outcomes included: Strengthening the ability to detect and respond to hybrid IT/OT threats in high-stakes environments. Enhancing coordination between field teams, CSOC analysts, and external regulatory and security entities. Providing invaluable exposure to realistic threat actor behaviours, improving defenders’ situational awareness and agility. Identifying process and tooling gaps that would be difficult to uncover outside a simulated crisis. Providing a mechanism to practice communication processes between incident responders and the senior leadership, translating events into business impact. By embedding hands-on technical simulations into their resilience strategy, participating organisations gained tactical readiness and deepened institutional understanding of how cyber events unfold – and how to lead effectively when they do. Case study: Enhancing cyber resilience in critical infrastructure sector We conducted a comprehensive cyber resilience exercise within the civil nuclear sector, to enhance the sector’s preparedness against increasingly sophisticated cyber and hybrid threats. The exercise brought together experts from nuclear plants, transport solutions, and cybersecurity agencies to improve incident management, collaboration, and crisis communication. The exercise aimed to address the challenges posed by sophisticated threat actors, complex supply and stakeholder chains, as well as complex converged IT, OT, and IIoT technical environments, all while simulating large-scale cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. With the global energy sector experiencing a 74% increase in cyberattacks over the past year alone, and the nuclear industry being a high-value target for geopolitical adversaries, the threat is no longer theoretical – it is urgent, persistent, and evolving. The main objectives of the exercise were to: Train Incident Response Teams (RRTs) and Central Security Operations Centres (CSOCs) in cyber incident management. Enhance communication skills and collaboration during crises. Evaluate the integration of IT and OT systems in responding to cyber threats. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The exercise simulated cyberattacks from a fictional geopolitical entity involving key nuclear and cybersecurity stakeholders. Pre-event training prepared participants with the necessary skills and knowledge on cyber threats and incident response. An essential component of the exercise was the After Action Report (AAR), which rigorously evaluated team and organisational performance. The AAR captured detailed insights into what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve. Following the recommendations, participating organisations were able to close identified vulnerabilities, reduce incident response time by up to 30%, and update response plans to reflect real-world threat dynamics. Moreover, the structured debriefing process improved internal coordination scores across teams by 40% compared to baseline assessments conducted prior to the exercise. These measurable improvements have since informed investment decisions, governance updates, and the design of future training initiatives. Participating organisations were able to close identified vulnerabilities, reduce incident response time, and update response plans to reflect real-world threat dynamics. 30% reduced incident response time 40% improved internal coordination score The exercise highlighted key areas for improvement, such as leadership under pressure and IT/OT coordination. It demonstrated that only through regular, organisation-specific exercises – combined with thorough AAR analysis – can organisations in critical infrastructure stay ahead of rapidly advancing threats and build the operational muscle memory required to respond with confidence and speed. Don’t wait for an attack to test your defences As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, organizations that fail to prepare risk severe financial and reputational damage. Integrating cyber exercises into your security strategy empowers your teams, strengthens defences, and builds a truly resilient organization. The question is not whether you will face a cyber incident but how prepared you are when it happens .

    "content": "Case study July 7, 2025 by Nortal Testing the cyber defences of a life sciences company A well-executed cyber exercise can mean the difference between a contained incident and a costly crisis. One global life sciences company put this to the test – and emerged significantly more resilient. Explore our cyber exercises Service Cyber Resilience Industry Industry An international life sciences and clinical research company headquartered in the United States has an admirable mission – to enable its customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. However, with global cybercrime costs growing by 15% annually, to deliver that promise to its 350,000 customers worldwide – rather than become the weak link in their supply chains – the company needed to evolve from a strong, functional security model to a world-class, fully integrated resilience programme that matched its market leadership and the critical nature of the supply chains it supports. The ripple effect The company commands a roughly 20% share of the global market, reflecting its extensive portfolio, which includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, clinical diagnostic laboratories, research institutions, and government agencies worldwide. But this also means the company is deeply embedded in vital supply chains, and a cyberattack could ripple across critical infrastructure and essential operations – not only in life sciences, but also in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, academia, and even national security-related research. For example, a breach in networked lab instruments and data management software could allow threat actors to push malicious updates or manipulate lab results. A cyberattack could result in delays to cancer diagnostics and critical therapies. Contrary to popular belief, technology is not the sole answer to cyber threats. Studies show that 82% of cyber breaches involve human error – but those same people can also become your strongest defence against cyberattacks. An FBI report noted that 53% of digital medical devices in the US are at risk of cyberattacks. Attack simulation A sound approach today is to assume a cyber incident will happen – after all, it’s a question of when, not if, you will be attacked. Being able to respond rapidly and effectively is critical to containing the financial, operational, and reputational impacts of that incident and in returning to normal operations. An expert response, however, doesn’t come naturally. It must be ingrained in muscle memory through exercise. To meet our client’s challenge, we designed and facilitated multiple tabletop exercises for the company’s global leadership and communications teams to move beyond theoretical plans and test their capabilities against a highly realistic, modern threat scenario. Our attack campaign simulated assaults on a core product line, creating downstream impacts on customers and triggering regulatory scrutiny. To mirror today’s information battlefield, the scenarios also included AI-generated deepfake content of the CEO, designed to sow confusion and damage public trust. We provided expert analysis after observing how the teams collaborated under pressure. This approach aligns with the proactive validation now expected by advanced regulations such as NIS2 and DORA, which require organisations in critical sectors to demonstrate their resilience in practice. The exercises initiated vital discussions on leadership roles, crisis coordination, and communication protocols, providing a safe environment in which to navigate the pressures of a real-world cyberattack. Enhanced incident preparedness The exercises delivered a comprehensive, executive-endorsed blueprint for advancing the organisation’s cyber maturity, ensuring its people, processes, technology, and culture are prepared for the future. Instead of reacting to a real crisis, the company is now proactively implementing a strategic roadmap built on insights from the exercises. Key impacts include: A framework for scalable response The exercise provided the business case for enhancing the company's incident management framework. Leadership is now equipped with a clear plan to implement a robust cross-training programme, ensuring a deep and scalable bench of talent ready to respond effectively. A plan for strategic communications The simulation delivered a strategic framework for maturing the company’s crisis communications. This has provided a clear path for establishing a formal ‘battle rhythm’ and developing a proactive messaging arsenal, preparing the team to control the narrative in a contested information space. A roadmap for integrated security The engagement produced a strategic roadmap for embedding a ‘Security by Design’ ethos across the product lifecycle. This has laid the groundwork for a ‘Security Champions’ programme, with plans to embed security expertise directly within R&D teams and foster a culture of shared ownership. By rehearsing for a crisis, this life sciences leader not only fortified its own defences, but also strengthened the integrity of the entire ecosystem it serves. In a sector where trust is paramount, and one weak link can halt vital services, preparedness is a collective asset . Don't wait for an attack to test your defences As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, organizations that fail to prepare risk severe financial and reputational damage.

    "title": "Digitalized delivery procedures save drivers time and improve customer experience",
    "content": "Case study July 3, 2023 Digitalized delivery procedures save drivers time and improve customer experience Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable raw materials for the chemical and polymer industries. They also develop chemical recycling of plastic waste to combat the plastic waste problem. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Nortal digitalized Neste’s driver’s processes, which have improved the security and reliability of Neste’s deliveries. Streamlining order and delivery information by digitalizing information sharing, Neste and their drivers are now providing their customers with faster and better quality service. Challenge Neste’s challenge was to speed up the flow of information and at the same time ensuring its accuracy and making the drivers’ job easier. Prior to the TOIMI solution, Neste’s drivers received printed consignment notes from the distribution terminal and manually entered the unloaded quantities. At the end of the day, the drivers brought the consignment notes back to the terminal, where the information was, once again, manually transferred into the office system. All of this manual work resulted in a delay of 2 to 4 days from unloading the cargo to sending the invoice. Every nation’s paperwork requirements are different, and requirements may differ at institutions within a nation. One university in Spain may want your high school diploma, another requires proof of income eligibility for scholarships. Different documents are needed and they are uploaded and downloaded on different platforms. When accessing hundreds of legacy systems across which data is scattered, users’ documents are located in a variety of government offices working in silos, making it time consuming to get documents for opening a business, changing schools, or any other bureaucratic task. Multiple log-ins may be required to chase down information and, at the personal level, it becomes an exercise in frustration. At the societal level, it’s a massive waste of resources. Calculations show that for the European Union, a single digital gateway (SDG) could help companies save 11 billion euros, and relieve citizens of 885,000 hours of labor. Solution Designed according to Neste’s business processes and needs, this new feature in the TOIMI system manages and controls the flow of oil products from to the end customer and the recording of freight data. This feature includes positioning systems for better route planning and navigation, which enable the drivers to provide more accurate delivery times for customers. Manual data is no longer needed, as the TOIMI system now functions with the delivery car’s equipment through in-car interfaces we created. To implement this solution, we used MS Visual Studio 2017 premium C#, HERE map data provided by Esri, and Esri’s ArcGIS pro routing engine. Timeline The system is now in use in around 140 vehicles, making around 500 000 customer visits per year. The operational vehicle system is equipped with a 4G data connection to the office system. 1998 The TOIMI system is taken into production use. 2005 The positioning information features are introduced. 2006 In 2006, a sealing feature was built into the system to provide proof of integrity, i.e. the quantity and quality of the oil product delivered to the final customer is the same as the product loaded at the terminal. 2015 The entire system is upgraded to a 64-bit environment. 2015 The entire system is upgraded to a 64-bit environment. Neste The TOIMI system has brought us clear service level and and image advantage compared to our competitors petroleum products in the transport of oil products. Our cooperation with Nortal has been of significant importance for us to achieve these benefits. Impact This new feature in the TOIMI system speeds up delivery management significantly providing accurate up-to-date data available for the drivers. As the drivers can see open orders directly in their trucks and can therefore deliver the product left in the load to the customer who needs it. In-car interfaces eliminate human-induced keystroke errors and detailed positioning, and map data reduce the risk of delivering products to the wrong addresses. The location of the car can be continuously monitored from a GPS device. The system keeps track of the total quantity of product they have on board and enables a near real-time view of the order book. Drivers can also browse, modify and send out delivery information, freight reports or queries directly from their trucks to the admin system. From the customer’s point of view, the digitalization of this process has improved the the security and reliability of deliveries. Streamlining order and delivery information by digitalizing information sharing, Neste Oil and their drivers are now providing their customers with faster and better quality service. Less manual work overall Less time spent on processing and invoicing deliveries. Deliveries are now invoiced the following night. The manual work at the terminal was reduced and processing of delivery quantities considerably speeded up. Faster delivery and delivery process Improved customer service, map, address and routing data. Optimal route selection and estimating the time of arrival. Versatile interfaces and connections to office system The drivers’ work becomes faster and easier, because all the necessary information is available and up-to-date.

    "title": "Real-time intelligence with Microsoft Fabric: A deep dive into the manufacturing industry",
    "content": "Blog April 3, 2025 by Parthsarthi Raghavan, Data Engineer, Nortal Finland Real-time intelligence with Microsoft Fabric: A deep dive into the manufacturing industry It might surprise you to learn that unplanned downtime can cost manufacturers up to $260,000 per hour, as highlighted by industry research on IIoT World. Leveraging real‑time intelligence is key to preventing these costly disruptions. In the fast-paced world of the manufacturing industry, real-time intelligence is not just a luxury - it’s a necessity. With increasing demands for efficiency, sustainability, and precision, the ability to process, analyze, and act on data in real-time has become a game-changer. In this blog, I’ll share insights from a recent project that challenged our team to rethink how data can solve operational bottlenecks while addressing a critical hurdle: ensuring adoption by shopfloor operators. Service Data and AI Industry Data and AI So, why is real-time intelligence such a game-changer? Because in today’s data-driven world, reacting quickly is no longer enough - businesses need to anticipate and act before issues arise. Real-time intelligence empowers businesses to make informed decisions instantly, and in the manufacturing industry, this can translate into: Real- t ime i ntelligence: W hy i t m atters Minimized downtime: Proactively resolving equipment issues before they escalate. Optimized production: Adjusting parameters in real-time to meet fluctuating demand. Improved quality control: Detecting defects instantly, reducing waste by 15-20% in pilot phases. In this particular project, Microsoft Fabric’s ability to integrate real-time data streams from diverse sources and deliver actionable insights was the cornerstone of achieving these outcomes. A r eal- l ife i mplementation: manufacturing c ase Our client, a global manufacturer, was striving to keep up with increasing production demands while minimizing downtime and waste. They were hindered by three critical challenges: Fragmented data systems: Insights were delayed due to siloed systems that couldn't communicate effectively with each other. Costly downtime: Maintenance was reactive, leading to high downtime costs that significantly impacted profitability. Technology resistance: Shopfloor teams were accustomed to manual processes and sceptical of adopting new systems. To address these challenges, our team collaborated closely with our customer to develop a data-driven solution tailored to their needs. As a Data Engineer on this project, my responsibilities included: Data modelling: I designed star-schema models to structure real-time machine data, enabling efficient analytics and simplifying complex datasets for actionable insights. API development: To bridge the gap between systems, I built RESTful APIs that connected SAP with Fabric’s EventHouse via MQTT and EventHub, ensuring seamless data flow and system interoperability. Data governance: Establishing a \"single source of truth\" was critical. I standardized data definitions and validation rules, ensuring analysts could rely on consistent and accurate information. Real-time intelligence management: I oversaw the end-to-end management of Fabric’s real-time data pipelines, optimizing performance to achieve sub-500ms latency for critical alerts and notifications. Elevating operational efficiency We began by connecting IoT data sources, including machine data from Kepware, Ignition, MQTT, and EventHub to Fabric’s EventHouse (Kusto Database). This integration enabled centralized and processed over 12,000 data points per minute, creating a unified data foundation critical for real-time insights. However, working with legacy systems presented a unique challenge. Many lacked APIs, requiring us to develop custom connectors to ensure seamless data flow between systems. By building intuitive real-time dashboards, we provided operators with live insights into line performance, enabling immediate corrective actions. These real-time dashboards are like having Google Maps for your production line - know where the traffic jams are before you’re stuck in them. With this current integration, workers also gained access to real-time safety protocols and training modules directly on the factory floor. This integration could reduce incident rates by up to 25% and increase overall safety awareness. The potential impressive results of this impact could include: 18 percent reduction in downtime within 3 months. 30 percent faster decision-making by operators using dashboards. 6 months to achieve ROI despite initial adoption hurdles. The result is a robust, integrated solution that empowered operators with real-time insights while reducing reliance on outdated, manual processes. By addressing both the technical and human aspects of implementation, we are able to ensure the solution's success across all levels of the organization. Key f eatures of Microsoft Fabric in a ction : As mentioned, Microsoft Fabric played a central role in transforming how data was collected, processed, and utilized . By leveraging its robust capabilities, the solution we built not only enhance s operational efficiency but also foster s collaboration and improved safety. Here are a few key features of Microsoft Fabric and how they came to life in this implementation : Unified data architecture Fabric’s seamless integration across data pipelines allows for real-time ingestion and processing of data from machines via Kepware, integrated with Ignition, and then transmitted through MQTT to EventHub before being ingested into Fabric’s EventHouse (Kusto Database). This setup enabled us to capture machine performance and production data efficiently. Think of your data pipeline as your internet connection - faster is better, but reliability is key. Don’t let your data packets “buffer.” Real-time analytics With Fabric’s Synapse Real-Time Analytics capabilities, we processed high-velocity data streams to identify bottlenecks and enhance production monitoring. If you’ve ever waited for a 10GB file to upload, you’ll appreciate why low-latency analytics feels like upgrading from dial-up to fiber optic. Collaborative workflows Fabric’s unified platform brought together data engineers, analysts, and domain experts, fostering collaboration. This streamlined workflows and accelerated decision-making during the implementation phase. It’s like having all your teammates in the same Slack channel - minus the memes (but we wouldn’t complain if Fabric added that feature). Integration for operational health and safety In a key enhancement, we integrated a solution into our operations to support health and safety initiatives. This solution’s digital platform provided real-time access to training materials, incident reporting, and safety updates, ensuring a safer work environment and boosting compliance. Treat your safety data like an IT backup - always accessible and updated, because you never know when you’ll need it. Personal insights: The real impact of real-time intelligence Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. In my role I had the opportunity to design scalable data models and build integrations that truly made an impact on real-world operations. One of the biggest \"aha\" moments for me was seeing how real-time intelligence isn't just about technology - it's about changing the way people work. Initially, shopfloor operators were sceptical of the real-time dashboards, preferring their manual tracking methods. Instead of forcing adoption, we took another approach and worked closely with them to understand their workflows, address their concerns, and gradually demonstrate how real-time data could make their jobs easier rather than more complicated. Another key takeaway was the power of unified data architecture. Bringing together IoT, SAP, and Microsoft Fabric into a single, streamlined pipeline not only reduced downtime but also improved decision-making at every level - from operators on the floor to leadership teams analyzing trends. At Nortal, we don’t just build solutions - we rethink how technology integrates into business workflows. Seeing our work result in 18% downtime reduction and a 30% increase in operator efficiency made all the long hours and problem-solving absolutely worth it. If you’re passionate about data, problem-solving, and making a real impact, Fabric and Nortal provide an exciting playground to do just that! While Microsoft Fabric transformed our client’s operations, the human element was truly the key to success in this project. By blending technical expertise with empathy for end-users, we turned resistance into enthusiasm. As one operator remarked, “Now I can actually fix problems before my shift ends.” So, in conclusion, with this project we’ve proven that real-time intelligence isn’t just about data - it’s about empowering people. Conclusion As with all architectural decisions, the platform approach has trade-offs, and it is impossible to recommend a one-size-fits-all approach. Well-executed platform architecture can offer multiple benefits, such as accelerated delivery, TCO per application, and consistent user experience. On the other hand, the platform has lifecycle costs, requires good engineering skills, and it is not easy to calculate the ROI beforehand. However, by focusing on measurable outcomes and continuous improvement, you can demonstrate the value of your platform over time. To start your platform journey, it's crucial to approach platform development strategically and understand your organization's specific needs and goals. By starting small, focusing on measurable outcomes, and prioritizing alignment between technology and business, you can harness the full potential of platform engineering and build a foundation for sustainable growth. With the rise of AI and automation, platforms will become even more intelligent and adaptable, further streamlining development and operations.

    "content": "Article May 26, 2025 Revolutionizing your factory operations Nortal's Edge Platform stands on 30 years of industrial experience. Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Manufacturing Data and AI Imagine a digital factory where machines communicate seamlessly, data is processed in real-time, mission-critical applications are deployed in minutes, and AI-powered decisions are made without delay. Then imagine dozens of such factories – your factories – running globally. This is what edge computing promises to you, the industrial technology decision-maker. Processing data closer to where it's produced, rather than sending it all to the cloud, is crucial for applications that require extremely low latencies in functions like predictive maintenance, quality control, or worker safety. Such can be, e.g., a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusts its actions based on real-time system feedback to maintain a desired production quality level, or a real-time video surveillance application to prevent the paths of humans and automated forklifts from colliding at a factory site. In addition to eliminating latencies, local data processing ensures that operations can continue even if the connection to the central cloud is lost. From s ilos to c onsistent c ompany- w ide e dge c omputing The benefits of edge computing are clear, and the technology for edge computing has existed for at least a decade. However, the commonly adopted approach of implementing edge computing separately at each factory as siloed projects has often led to redundant efforts, increased costs, and a lack of central government and monitoring. Nortal’s vision for the “next-generation edge platform” is to deploy, monitor, and manage applications at the edge using the same tools and practices we use in the public cloud, i.e., to extend the cloud computing principles to the edge. The grounding principles are the same as those for any technology platform, as described in Nortal’s previous post by Aki Pehkonen: to enable the business to move faster and more efficiently towards its goals. We have designed Nortal's Edge Platform to unlock the full potential of edge computing in large industrial settings, and we’ve already started piloting the approach with a leading customer. Based on our experience in the industrial landscape, the benefits of next-generation edge platform can be manifold for corporations with many sites globally: Agility and speed: With a common platform and processes, deploying and managing applications across your factories is faster and easier, new innovative solutions can be developed and scaled more agilely, and the silos between information technology and operational (IT/OT) systems can be broken to ultilize all accessible data more efficiently. Cost Efficiency : Centralized management and deployment of applications and the capabilities created for remote operations reduce your infrastructure and personnel costs, and removing overlapping solutions enables savings. Risk Mitigation: Security protocols that are the same for all factories reduce the risk of breaches and ensure compliance with industry standards. Nortal’s edge platform’s open approach to technology vendors allows you to choose the best solutions and avoid vendor lock-in and related risks. AI Readiness: Standardized tools and processes allow you to scale AI innovations and models to all factories “in minutes.\" The Edge Platform simplifies the deployment and management of Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) models in production, while ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost management. How to s tep u p y our g ame with Nortal's e dge p latform While many edge platform solutions may lead to vendor lock-in and closed environments, our approach is different. We have developed an open, cloud-native edge platform based on open standards and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects. This approach enables you to choose the right tools and avoid vendor lock-ins. Our platform supports applications from various vendors, allowing you to select the best, most cost-effective components for your needs, fully benefit from the investments you have already made, and innovate more efficiently. With our extensive experience working with leading industrial customers and their OT/IT environments, we help you make the best architecture choices for your business. Our edge platform is based on a composable architecture and covers five key layers that can consist of the technology solutions you prefer : Infrastructure : Utilizing tools like Azure Local, the foundational layer includes physical and virtual resources in your factories’ on-premises server room that ensure high availability and reliability, e.g., networking components, storage systems, and hardware resources. Compute : With Kubernetes technology at its core, the compute entity includes virtual machines and containers that execute the application logic and data processing. It also enables rapid deployment and consistent management of containerized applications across all factory locations. Core Services: Standardized core services capabilities such as databases, APIs, integrations, and message brokers make application development and deployments easier and ensure all necessary data is available for your applications. Applications: The development and deployment of containerized applications for your business and operational needs stay in your hands and those of your selected application development vendors, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. The platform ensures seamless interaction with the underlying data and core services. Management in the Cloud: Tools like Azure Arc enable the deployment, management, and monitoring of the above-mentioned edge resources and workloads. The edge platform offers a single control panel across your global factories. With this next-generation Edge Platform, Nortal can help you efficiently, securely, and scalably orchestrate the entity described above across your factory sites. Our guidelines and best practices are based on our 30 years of expertise in industrial environments. Still, the platform allows you to continue to benefit from your current infrastructure, application partners, and tools to implement the edge computing architecture and processes best suited to your operational needs. The time is now Switching to a next-generation Edge Platform is not just a tech upgrade but a smart move that can improve how your factories work, make them safer, and save money. Edge computing supports digital transformation technologies like the Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These technologies rely on low-latency, high-bandwidth data processing, which edge computing can provide. Edge computing lowers costs and emissions by diminishing the need to send data over networks, reduces security and compliance risks, and keeps operations running even if the cloud connection is lost.

    "content": "Article April 2, 2025 by Aki Pehkonen, Head of Cloud, Nortal Finland What are platforms, and do I need one? Back in the day, when I started my software engineering career, most of the custom enterprise applications were built using a single tech stack. A few of the most common ones were a Java stack with an Oracle database or a Microsoft stack with an SQL Server database. At that time, a typical enterprise system was a product family of desktop applications with a two-tier architecture organized in a monolith codebase. Service Data and AI Industry Data and AI From frameworks to platforms Since enterprise applications typically have shared concerns, such as handling database connections, localization, authentication and authorization, logging, release management, etc., the standard approach was to create a foundation framework for these capabilities to create a consistent architecture. Although this approach works reasonably well, the downside is that it often creates a steeper learning curve to understand its conventions and structures and might limit the ability to use more modern approaches. Luckily, most of these development concerns have already been solved in modern application frameworks such as Spring Boot or ASP.NET. In most cases, those frameworks already offer most of the foundational capabilities, and they are extensible with commercial and open source to solve more specific use cases. Software architecture has evolved a lot in the last 20 years. Instead of monolith applications, mainstream enterprise applications are collections of distributed (micro)services that communicate with each other via HTTP and are deployed to the public cloud. The same type of architecture is also widely used in commercial SaaS applications, and when done right, the distributed nature of the architecture is not visible to the end user. Although distributed application architectures are more flexible and scalable when appropriately done, they also have tradeoffs with architecture and deployment complexity. While solving the increasing complexity of emerging architectures, the software industry has coined a new term, Platform Engineering, which is typically a set of services, tooling, and guidance for engineers to autonomously build new capabilities that meet domain requirements in a repeatable way. At its core, it is not very different from the old-school framework development, and the purpose is the same: let engineering teams focus on the application logic and streamline deployment and operations while maintaining alignment with the ecosystem. What are internal development platforms and platform engineering? The idea of Internal Development Platforms (IDPs) has roots in the original platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings like Heroku and Cloud Foundry and the internal development platforms built by large tech companies such as Google, Netflix, and Spotify. The fundamental goal is to reduce the cognitive load on developers by creating opinionated, pre-configured workflows that developers can use to deliver value faster while avoiding repetitive infrastructure setups. Also, mainstream cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have their own PaaS offerings. The latest generation of their PaaS products are container-based and serverless, with a usage-based pricing model that almost entirely abstracts away complex parts such as container orchestrations. PaaS services have an easier learning curve, but at the same time, they are less flexible and may not be cost-efficient when used at scale. In addition to the general-purpose PaaS services, there’s also a movement to more specialized and higher abstraction level platforms, such as integration, low-code, and data platforms — some attempt to democratize the development process and allow more people to contribute. Good examples of these services are Microsoft’s Power Platform and Microsoft Fabric, which many Nortal customers are adopting now. In most cases, internal development platforms are not built on bare metal; they are a combination of capabilities to deliver specific workloads. For example, an integration platform can provide capabilities different from those of a data platform. Still, both should offer APIs and self-service capabilities to allow multiple teams to deliver value independently without the ticket-driven approach common for traditional IT infrastructures. For the solutions running in the public cloud, the IDP can be a curated list of available capabilities or an enabling layer for on-prem infrastructure to build cloud-native services. In this context, the platform engineering team is responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting the IDP for the rest of the organization. To some extent, platform engineering is an evolution from DevOps practices; instead of building non-functional system qualities in an ad-hoc manner, platform engineering is an attempt to productize and standardize these capabilities on the platform. Team topologies and Platform Engineering Any platform engineering initiative success heavily depends on the organizational structure and how teams interact. The principles of Team Topologies , a model developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais, provide a valuable framework for aligning teams with platform development and consumption. The basic idea of team topologies comes from Conway’s Law , which states that “ organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations” . In simpler terms, how your teams communicate directly influences the architecture of your software. The Team Topologies leverage this idea by offering practical advice on deliberately structuring the team to reflect the desired architectural structure. This approach is often called a reverse or inverse Conway’s Maneuver; instead of fighting against Conway’s Law, it leverages it to drive the desired change. Team Topologies identifies four fundamental team types: Stream-Aligned Teams These teams are responsible for delivering end-to-end value to customers. They should be able to work autonomously and own their services throughout their life cycle. Enabling Teams These teams provide specialized expertise and guidance to Stream-Aligned Teams, helping them adopt new technologies and practices. They act as consultants and collaborators. Complicated-Subsystem Teams These teams handle complex or specialized subsystems that require deep expertise. They build and maintain components that are difficult for Stream-Aligned Teams to manage. Platform Teams These teams are responsible for building and maintaining the internal development platform. They provide the tools, services, and infrastructure that Stream-Aligned Teams need to deliver value. The most critical team types in platform engineering are Stream-Aligned Teams and Platform Teams, where Stream-Aligned teams consume the platform and deliver business value. The platform team maintains and develops the platform itself. Adopting Team Topologies' principles helps define clear responsibilities and create necessary feedback loops between the teams for continuous improvements. Team structures should not be set in stone so the team compositions can adapt when the platform matures or the business changes. Many times, it also makes sense to switch roles once in a while to understand different aspects and needs of the platform. For example, if applicable, it is helpful for platform engineers to work alongside the stream-aligned team to understand the pain points of consuming the platform. Do you need a platform? Creating and maintaining a platform is not a project but an internal product line that requires the same practices, principles, and lifecycle management as any other software product. This is a significant undertaking, so before deciding to build your platform, it is crucial to determine the benefits your organization seeks to gain with the platform and how applicable they are to your domain. In general, platforms seek to benefit from economies of scale. The most obvious candidates for platforms are ecosystems with potentially multiple applications that require consistency or fewer applications but a considerable number of environments to deploy them. A good example of a platform with multiple applications is an application suite that covers a specific domain with small, focused applications that aim to provide a consistent user experience. This consistent user experience gives the illusion of using just one application, although technically, different sections on the screen might come from various sources. An example of many environments is an edge platform where applications can be deployed and updated automatically to the whole fleet of IoT devices or other edge services. In short, consider these questions to determine if a platform is right for you: Do you have multiple development teams working on related projects Are you experiencing significant duplication of effort in infrastructure setup or deployment? Do you want to enforce consistent security or compliance standards across your applications? Do you have a large number of deployments? Are you going to be deploying to edge locations or devices? Do you need to provide consistent user experience across multiple applications? The cost of not having the platform when you need one, is increased development efforts due to duplicated work, inconsistent security postures, and a slower time to market. Where to start? Regardless of the platform type, platform engineering seeks to deliver value more efficiently. To be truly impactful, this requires both strategic and technical thinking. While the technical side is concerned with having the right tools and infrastructure, the strategic side must align the platform with business goals, operational efficiency, and future growth. Ideally, a good starting point should be well-understood, not overly massive, and offer measurable outcomes. This is always a balancing act between complexity and business value; making it too small won’t provide tangible benefits but making it too big too early increases the risk of failure. Either way, failure means losing the organization’s momentum. Therefore, it is best to start with an MVP platform to receive feedback and improve based on actual needs. My advice is to come up with something that: Aligns technology and business goals Platform engineering isn’t just building tech to deliver even more tech but enabling the business to move faster and more efficiently. In essence, the question is: What does the business want to achieve, and how can technology help to get there? Questions : What are your long-term goals (e.g., faster time-to-market, create new product offering) Can the platform reduce existing costs? Do you want to tap into new revenue streams? (e.g., monetize existing assets, utilize a partner network) Can the platform deliver a better customer experience? Example: If a business goal is to enter new markets quickly, the platform should support scaling and deployments to multiple regions with reasonable cost and effort. Depending on the target regions, this might impact the platform for compliance and regulatory reasons. Operational Efficiency Very few companies worldwide don’t need to care about operational efficiency; it is not just about margins but also about staying competitive and providing better service at lower costs. Therefore, it makes sense to consider operational efficiency very early in the project. Strategic goals: Normalizing the tech stack helps manage the technical debt Reusable assets help build new capabilities with lower costs Standardized software delivery to reduce operational costs and optimize resource usage Example: A standardized cookie-cutter approach to delivering new applications means that each team creates the applications similarly, reducing errors and speeding up the delivery process. Is future proof Building a simplified user experience over a collection of open-source tools and various services requires pre-made decisions and defaults that limit the options that platform users need to make. The approach has a built-in trap; each simplification is one step away from the base platform and its APIs, and even when it seems like a simplification to the makers of the platform, it will be another layer of abstraction that consumers must learn. In most cases, it makes sense to use well-known standards and protocols. Strategic benefits: Ability to react to market changes Ability to adapt and integrate with new technologies, like AI Example: Modular architecture that communicates with other modules via well-defined APIs is adaptable to change, whilst the normalized platform allows for the maintenance of operational efficiency. Conclusion As with all architectural decisions, the platform approach has trade-offs, and it is impossible to recommend a one-size-fits-all approach. Well-executed platform architecture can offer multiple benefits, such as accelerated delivery, TCO per application, and consistent user experience. On the other hand, the platform has lifecycle costs, requires good engineering skills, and it is not easy to calculate the ROI beforehand. However, by focusing on measurable outcomes and continuous improvement, you can demonstrate the value of your platform over time. To start your platform journey, it's crucial to approach platform development strategically and understand your organization's specific needs and goals. By starting small, focusing on measurable outcomes, and prioritizing alignment between technology and business, you can harness the full potential of platform engineering and build a foundation for sustainable growth. With the rise of AI and automation, platforms will become even more intelligent and adaptable, further streamlining development and operations.

    "content": "Home Insights Microsoft Fabric is everywhere Article December 18, 2024 by Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland Microsoft Fabric is everywhere And if you’re on Power BI, you are already in! Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Manufacturing A few months ago, we at Nortal decided to pull a list of Finnish Data Architects , Chief Data Officers, and other data decision-makers from different industries . We started contacting them with the message of Fabric , Microsoft’s end-to-end analytics SaaS platform that unifies data from diverse operational and information technology systems. It has been astonishing to witness the level of engagement among the respondents of this outreach, as it has already yielded dozens of interactions with interested prospective customers for us . Fabric is coming in through doors and windows As one of the prospective customers put it: “Fabric is coming in through doors and windows, now.” No matter if your company or organization already has an existing data platform or is just considering investing in one, the flexibility of Microsoft Fabric means nobody needs to miss out on the opportunity to adopt an agile platform and its AI tools to make sense of the data stored in different systems around the organization . And the best part is that you may already be on t his train! Nortal pioneers with the pioneering Microsoft Fabric Microsoft Fabric’s appeal lies in its unique features: Its agile nature as a SaaS solution that allows for quick setup times and eliminates the need for infrastructure management, its OneLake storage approach that supports the modern data lakehouse architecture, and it offers a seamlessly integrated data and AI experience that is familiar from Microsoft’s Azure. Although many of the platform’s possibilities have been on the market for some time in other solutions, the agility of deployment and time-to-value are unprecedented. Nortal is proud to be part of a select group of frontrunner partners who work actively and hands-on with Microsoft Fabric. Our recognition as a Microsoft Fabric Featured Partner is a testament to our recent experience deploying real-life customer solutions on Fabric. Unlock the power of unified data solutions with Microsoft Fabric Learn more about our Microsoft Fabric expertise – Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland We're helping numerous customers who want to try something new on the side of their existing data platform, are entirely new to data platforms, or are seeking to overcome the challenges with their previous data platform projects. Microsoft Fabric Kick-Start: born from our experiences With Nortal’s expertise from years of building Azure-based data platforms and workloads and working with tens of customer organizations, we have identified six concrete steps to get started with Microsoft Fabric and test it with real-life use cases . As we speak, we are applying these steps to our pioneering customers. Six steps and 4 – 8 weeks to a platform pilot First, we will scope the project to map the use cases in focus and the business value the customer wants to pull from them. A design-first approach ensures we understand the end-user’s needs and consider the solutions’ usability. Second, the data is modeled, and data architecture, Fabric capacity strategy, and governance are carefully designed to ensure that we build a scalable solution that suits future needs. Third, we will implement the solution separately in test, development, and production environments to allow further development without interfering with everyday business. Fourth, thorough testing always needs to be done from the viewpoints of the functionality, the integrations, the performance, and the end-user experience. As the fifth step, it is vital to train the customer’s end-users to ensure that knowledge is efficiently transferred from Nortal’s project team to the customer experts. Finally, we provide our customers with comprehensive solution documentation that includes the architecture decisions made during the pilot and the description of support mechanisms. This ensures that the solution keeps adding value to the customer’s business now and in the future. Although these six steps may seem laborious, they are crucial for the success of a data platform pilot project – no matter how agile the technology solution in question is. Also, with our well-thought-through process, the duration of all six steps can be squeezed to as little as four to eight weeks. While Microsoft Fabric as a solution is lightweight and scalable, so should the projects that help you prove its viability and usefulness. You may already be on the right train As pointed out , it is almost surprising how many Finnish organizations are already looking at Microsoft Fabric , be their business in manufacturing, financial services, professional services, or the public sector. The delightful finding for many may be that if you are using PowerBI , you probably already are on the Microsoft Fabric wagon. Microsoft Fabric capacity will replace Power BI capacity licenses Microsoft has announced that Microsoft Fabric capacity licenses will replace Power BI Premium per capacity licenses. While Power BI enjoys the position as the leading business intelligence solution, holding more than one-third of the business intelligence market, it is likely that most of the leading organizations already have licenses for it. The change means that as a Power BI Premium customer, you will need to switch your existing Power BI Premium capacities to the new Fabric capacities at your next renewal. Once in Fabric, you’ll have access toother Fabric experiences, better integration with Azure services, and more flexible billing options, ensuring a seamless upgrade from pure Power BI to Microsoft Fabric without losing access to your current workspaces and data. Thus, the upcoming changes in Power BI licensing present new opportunities to leverage all the features of the Fabric platform instead of being limited to reporting only. However, this also introduces a challenge: when capacity is shared among Power BI and the other capabilities of Fabric, your organization might encounter a situation where capacity runs out from, e.g., the daily Power BI reporting. To avoid such disruptions in the accustomed reporting services, it is essential to have a skilled partner that can develop a Fabric capacity strategy. Such a strategy optimizes capacity acquisition for different domains and ensures that, for example, your data scientists and reporting have their dedicated resources in Fabric. So, without knowing, you may already be on board with what we consider the most interesting business analytics solution available today. With Nortal’s Microsoft Fabric Kick-Start concept, the risk and effort of proofing and implementing this new technology is minimal, while the potential benefits for your business could be massive.
