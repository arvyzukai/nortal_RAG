A culture of growth and meaningful work Leadership Founder's perspective I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO The opportunity to reshape the future is now I founded Nortal 25 years ago in Estonia with a simple idea: IT and technology often struggled to understand government and business, just as businesses and governments found it challenging to get the value out of IT and technology in a smart way. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap. I envisioned a society where everything just works. Everything happens in the background seamlessly, so citizens and businesses can focus on what truly matters—what they care about and what creates value. I wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and automate any task that does not need a human to perform it. I believed digitalization could unlock this potential—and so much more. Today, Estonia is the first country where all government services are 100% digital, and Nortal has grown into a global player, helping governments across North America, Europe and the Middle East create digital solutions that are citizen-centered, resilient, and deliver real outcomes. Many of my dreams have already come true, and I’m proud of our role in making that happen. But the world is changing faster than ever. Artificial intelligence, globalization, energy and climate crises, geopolitical tensions, and a generation of kids growing up in a fully digital world are reshaping what we expect from society. As the world changes, we need to have the will and courage to dream and reinvent the future we want our children to inherit. - Priit Alamäe, Founder and CEO Delivering value across industries Public Sector Transforming governments in the digital age.

    "content": "Government efficiency in the age of AI This white paper explores how applying democratic design principles to digital infrastructure creates governments that are both more capable and more trusted. Get the white paper Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? The race between digital democracy and digital control Digital technology is redefining how governments operate. It can make institutions faster and more effective, or more centralized and opaque. The next decade will decide whether AI-enabled governments evolve as open, participatory systems or drift toward digital authoritarianism. The architecture built today will determine how freedom, trust and efficiency coexist in the decades to come. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. Explore system-level efficiency Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for whole-of-government system efficiency The paper introduces system-level efficiency as a new benchmark for digital governance. It measures performance not by speed or cost alone but by how well digital systems reinforce trust, capacity and adaptability across government. System-level efficiency arises when operational performance, state capacity and public trust advance together, constrained by four strategic factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Explore the new governance benchmark A roadmap to efficient digital democracy The white paper outlines three stages for governments pursuing both efficiency and legitimacy: Build a trusted foundation. Base registries, digital identity, data exchange and transparency tools give citizens confidence and control. Increase intelligence. Integrate systems to enable proactive, AI-supported services that remain explainable and fair. Prepare for democratic cyberocracy. Leverage data and AI for real-time governance while preserving oversight, participation and the rule of law. Democracy: the most efficient form of governance The paper’s conclusion is clear: democracy is not an obstacle to efficiency, it is its foundation. Its core principles, representation, accountability, transparency and subsidiarity, optimize outcomes and resource use across government. Embedded into digital architecture, these principles guide choices about open standards, federated data exchange and algorithmic transparency. Governments that design for both democracy and efficiency create systems that are more trusted, resilient and adaptive. The digital governments of the future will not only deliver better outcomes; they will strengthen the democratic fabric itself.

    "content": "Securing today, forging the defence of tomorrow: Through digital mastery. In a time where resilience is non-discretionary, we empower the Armed Forces and Defence Ministries to maintain operational advantage through data-led transformation. Get in touch! An area undergoing digital change The Nortal Factor Our experience building the world’s first digital government has established a scalable digital transformation and resilience model. This, coupled with our extensive catalogue of best practices across both public and private sectors, positions us uniquely in Europe, NATO, and globally. We can amplify existing digital, defensive cyber, and resilience practices within defence to build capacity and protect the supply chain, industry partners, and broader national security. This is not just an episodic national endeavour but a global necessity – the crises we face are international in scope, demanding cross-border collaboration and partnerships. Core capabilities All sectors need to consider how they contribute to an existential survival crisis. A symbiotic exchange between defence and broader public and private sector knowledge is required. We can make this a reality. Digital Transformation Digital transformation replaces outdated processes with streamlined, adaptive systems, empowering defence organisations to act with speed, precision, and agility. By achieving decision advantage, enhancing resilience, and outpacing evolving threats, it enables the shift from rigid inefficiency to dynamic capability-delivering unmatched operational superiority and securing the future of defence. Data Exploitation Exploitation unlocks the power of information, transforming complexity into clarity and raw data into actionable insights. By driving smarter decisions, operational precision, and strategic foresight, we equip defence organisations to strengthen resilience, maintain decision advantage, and gain the critical edge needed to stay ahead of evolving threats. Cyber Force Protection Cyber Force Protection is more than defence—it is a trusted partnership that transforms mindsets and builds resilience from strategy to implementation and beyond. We enable defence organisations to proactively secure critical systems, sustain operational continuity, and achieve superiority in the digital battlespace, ensuring success in a rapidly changing threat environment. Resilience Resilience underpins every aspect of modern defence and is the product of digital transformation, data exploitation and cyber force protection —ensuring systems, data, and operations can withstand, adapt, and thrive in the face of disruption. This forces a paradigm shift: embedding resilience at every level (technology, people, and process) we empower organisations to maintain decision advantage, secure mission success, and safeguard critical capabilities in an unpredictable digital world. In an ever-increasing threat environment, our dependency on technology and data is the ‘vital ground’ of 21st-century competition and conflicts. Nortal is uniquely positioned to translate a nation-state’s government digitisation into the defence of nations, coalitions, and alliances – harnessing R&D to deliver digital transformation, ensure resilience, and set conditions for cyber force protection. – Nick Washer, Global Head of Defence at Nortal Our portfolio We are uniquely positioned as a reliable partner in the aerospace and defence sector.

Download the full white paper Democratic stability and service continuity during crises We are living in times of multiple crises. Pandemics, conflicts, and climate change are testing the resilience of our institutions and democracy. Nearly 30% of governments in Europe had to postpone elections during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, highlighting the need for digital continuity of state functions in the face of challenges. As a result, policymakers are now making large investments into their digital capabilities to ensure the digital continuity of state functions during times of crisis. The future of resilient governance lies in building digital states that can operate and deliver services from anywhere, withstanding threats in both physical and virtual worlds. Learn more from our white paper Building digital resilience The seven key policies suggested in the study are intended to help build and strengthen the resilience of a state’s digital infrastructure. If built properly, a sufficiently resilient digital state could run its core and critical digital services even if there was a temporary or more long-term loss of its physical territory due to a crisis. To remain relevant, states must digitalize As states undergo the transformation into new digital states, it is of the utmost importance to think strategically about how to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure. These recommendations, if adopted, will help to ensure that a digital state can function even when facing the worst of crises. Digital-first approach to public services and registries related to the continuity of the state. Transition to public sector jobs that can operate in a remote-first or remote-enabled manner. Prioritizing the security of digital infrastructure and services. Resilience in connectivity by viewing internet access as critical infrastructure. Reduced opportunities for physical damage to disrupt their digital operations. Managed third-party risk without limiting opportunities for technological innovation.

    "content": "From docks to data: Charting a course for cyber resilience in the smart port era New insights on securing hyper-connected ports against operational shutdowns, supply chain disruption, and escalating cyber threats. Get the white paper Service Cyber Resilience Industry Logistics The convergence of IT, OT, and emerging AI has unlocked unprecedented efficiency across port operations. At the same time, it has erased traditional security boundaries — introducing new forms of risk that extend far beyond data loss. Can smart ports deliver efficiency without exposing operations and global supply chains to systemic cyber risk? Cyber risk is no longer just digital Cyber threats are no longer confined to data theft; they now pose a direct risk of operational paralysis, physical sabotage, and systemic supply chain disruption that can ripple across the globe. A single, well-executed cyber incident can bring a major port to a standstill — incurring millions in losses per day and triggering cascading failures across international supply chains. Read the white paper €200k per hour is the estimated downtime cost for one large port in UK. €95B could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region 90% of port and terminal executives felt \"Very confident\" in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering... 45% of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach that year before. Despite clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within maritime leadership, creating one of the most significant strategic blind spots. When the perimeter disappears The traditional approach to cybersecurity, built around strong perimeters and assumed trust, is no longer sufficient in a hyper-connected port ecosystem. True resilience requires a shift from reactive, compliance-driven security toward strategies designed for an assumed-breach reality. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. A framework for maritime cyber resilience This white paper moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience — combining resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defence. It provides an actionable roadmap to help port leadership: Understand the modern cyber-physical threat landscape Reduce exposure across converged IT, OT, and third-party environments Build resilience that supports continuity, compliance, and trust Resilience as the new North Star Cybersecurity is no longer a back-office IT function or a cost centre. It is a core component of operational infrastructure and business continuity — and a defining factor in the reliability of global trade.

    "content": "Home Insights Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Article March 13, 2025 James Thomas, Global Head of Cyber | Michael Hampson Embedding resilience: Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. Download the Embedding resilience paper Service Cyber Resilience Strategy and Transformation It’s not a question of if you will be attacked; it’s a question of when. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 99% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months A resilient culture This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience—embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer-centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. Investing in cyber resilience The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Measuring the impact €10.5tn is the predicted cost of cybercrime globally in 2025 €4.66m was the average cost of a data breach ion 2024 €4.76m was the average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 The cost of cyber resilience So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: How does the organisation make money or deliver value? What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/or services provided? What is the threat to each? Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. The building blocks of embedding resilience A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation. 01. Governance & strategy The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. Leadership commitment and clear accountability Risk management and asset identification (aligns with NIST’s Identify function and ISO’s context and leadership clauses) Integration of cyber resilience into business continuity planning Regular review and refinement of policies to address evolving threats Regulatory and legal compliance, mapping to relevant standards Organisational value alignment; cyber strategies support business objectives and value generation Reporting structures and escalation pathways Investment prioritization Operational dependency mapping Operational Impact analysis (BIA) 02. Protect & secure The traditional defen ce layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience. Deliberate security architectures aligned to organisational goals, objectives, and structures Resilience by design principles Supply chain security controls Security culture and capability development Access controls, encryption, and network security measures Endpoint and application security Regular vulnerability assessments, patch management, and continuous security and business alignment validation Alignment with the “Protect” function of NIST and the Annex A controls of ISO 27001 03. Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organ isation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements Supply chain security and third-party risk management Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements 04. Intelligence & adaptation A continuous learning loop that leverages threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defen ces and responses. The intelligence and adaption block ensures that organisations can systematically analyse the value of their current defences and make informed adjustments where necessary. Moreover, the adaption process involves internalizing lessons learned from post-incident reviews and active engagement with external intelligence sources and collaborative industry networks. This ensures that our organisations learn and grow from our own experiences and also from those of other organisations. It also ensures that we remain at the forefront of best practices and can continually refine our policies and processes to meet new challenges head-on. Proactive threat hunting and continuous monitoring Intelligence-led testing and validation Analytics, reporting, and feedback mechanisms Emerging Tech impact assessments Predictive analytics Incorporation of lessons learned into strategy, policy, and process updates Engagement with external intelligence sources and collaboration with industry peers Review of emerging threats and recommendations regarding strategy, policy, and process Embedding resilience To embed the cyber resilience process, we need to embrace erudition, constantly learn from our mistakes, and then adapt and apply those lessons to any given context, not once, not twice, but continuously. Cyber resilience can then be embedded through four distinct phases, constantly monitored as threats and risks evolve. Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping involves deeply examining an organisation’s purpose to understand the value it provides to stakeholders and to identify critical functions that must be maintained under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping help uncover how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing key interdependencies that affect resilience. This process extends to stakeholder relationships, offering a broader understanding of the organisation’s ecosystem, including its supply chain. By clarifying purpose and operations, mission mapping allows for the examination of assumptions, ultimately strengthening organisational resilience. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers. This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability.

    "content": "Home Insights Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Case study March 7, 2025 Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen Technology alone cannot secure a government’s digital future, but trust in governance might be weaker without it. X-Road® helps governments regain control by strengthening trust between citizens and the state. Nortal has played a key role in building the digital foundation that keeps modern democracies running. Service Digital Trust Seamless Experiences Transformation Industry Public Sector Government Keeping chaos at bay In the digital age, the notion of “conflict” is expanding, and cyberattacks are an unavoidable part of the world’s new digital reality. For some, they are a daily occurrence. In 2007, Estonia suffered one of the first nationwide cyberattacks in the world. The massive assault, coming from Russia and aimed at destabilizing critical infrastructure, was a wake-up call for the young digital society. In response, Estonia swiftly enacted new cybersecurity laws, strengthened regulations, and invested heavily in improving digital infrastructure resiliency. This was a prescient move because cyberattacks never ceased. Estonia stands as one of the most cyber-targeted nations in the world, yet it has also become one of the most cyber-resilient and advanced digital nations. Despite relentless attempts to breach its systems, the country has maintained uninterrupted digital services. In most cases, Estonian residents have not been aware that the nation was under assault. What’s behind Estonia’s resilience? Strategic foresight, robust digital governance and a technological backbone designed for both security and scalability. At the core of it all is X-Road. Not built as a crisis management tool, but it works well in one Secure decentralized data exchange was the core principle for designing X-Road, and its architecture makes it inherently resilient in times of disruption. Built as a core component of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure (DPI) in 2001, X-Road was designed to enable secure, seamless, and efficient data exchange between government institutions and also with the private sector. Estonia’s ability to maintain uninterrupted digital services despite constant cyber threats has not only secured its own governance but has also positioned it as a model for others. As governments worldwide face similar challenges, many have turned to Estonia’s digital infrastructure for guidance. Today, X-Road is far more than a domestic solution—it has become a global de facto standard for secure data interoperability facilitated by governments. It has been adopted in more than 25 countries and territories, providing a robust foundation for secure data exchange across diverse regulatory environments. In Estonia alone, up to thousands of public and private sector organizations integrate with the local X-Road ecosystem called “X-tee” (X-Road’s original name in Estonian), leveraging its built-in security and efficiency to streamline operations and enhance citizen services. Among others, Ukraine has implemented a data-sharing ecosystem with a model similar to X-Road, known as Trembita, ensuring secure and uninterrupted digital government operations – even in times of crisis. Case study: Estonia While X-Road’s success is now global, its origins are deeply rooted in Estonia’s need to build an entirely new state from the ground up after regaining independence in 1991. The country was faced with the problem of having no systems at all—no digital infrastructure, no administration, no legal code—it was organizational chaos. But the nation did have visionary leaders, plus a host of engineers and cryptographers. It took the digital path. The X-Road ecosystem in Estonia is operated by the Information System Authority . X-Road has been in use for over two decades and made the nation a digital showcase, leading many to call it “the most digital society on earth.” From its inception, X-Road has been more than just a digital backbone—it is a cornerstone of Estonia’s cyber-resilience. Despite persistent cyber threats, including repeated attacks from Russian-linked actors, for over two decades, there has been no known major X-Road security breach or data leak. In its entire operational history in Estonia, X-Road has experienced only brief, partial disruptions affecting only individual services—an impressive track record for a nationwide digital infrastructure. At its inception in 2001, Estonian engineers designed X-Road to enable secure, cost-efficient data exchange within the government while minimizing system integration complexity. Rather than creating isolated connections between government agencies, Estonia developed a standardized, reusable infrastructure that operates securely over the public Internet. This approach ensured data sovereignty while enabling seamless interoperability between both public and private sector systems. In 2013, the Prime Ministers of Estonia and Finland signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on “developing and maintaining a software environment enabling secure connectivity, searches and data transfers between various governmental and private databases.” A couple of years later, in 2015, Finland adopted the system, and in 2017, Estonia and Finland further strengthened their cooperation by establishing the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) to oversee the development of X-Road as an open-source solution. As of December 2024, Estonia has achieved 100% digitalization of its government services, an unprecedented milestone in digital governance. In recent years, the country has rapidly advanced in the United Nations E-Government Development Index (EGDI), rising from 16th place in 2018 to 2nd in 2024. This achievement is more than just an improved ranking—it underscores the efficiency of Estonia’s digital public infrastructure, with X-Road at its core. Impacts: the world X-Road’s impact goes far beyond the Nordic countries. As digital governance becomes a global necessity, nations worldwide are turning to X-Road for its security, efficiency, and trust-building power. Beyond enabling seamless and secure data exchange, X-Road has far-reaching effects across multiple domains. From driving economic efficiency and strengthening trust through transparency to ensuring data sovereignty and promoting sustainable interoperability, its impact is reshaping how governments operate in the digital age. 01. Economics Although the exact economic impact of X-Road is difficult to measure, its benefits are undeniable. Estonia’s X-Road ecosystem processes approximately 295 million requests per month, with only 3% triggered by direct citizen interactions. If each request behind these interactions saves just 10 minutes, Estonia recovers an estimated 1.48 million hours of working time every month—an impressive gain for a nation with a relatively small population. The true efficiency boost is even greater, as most requests are machine-to-machine interactions that eliminate the need for manual processing. Across Estonia and other countries, X-Road has enabled automation and real-time data processing, increasing process efficiency more than fivefold in various sectors. The platform has also fostered robust public-private partnerships in Estonia by connecting around 1,000 institutions and enterprises, ultimately extending its value to an additional 52,000 organizations. The impact of X-Road can be seen not only within the nations that use it but also with their trading partners. With its Trust Federation feature, X-Road also facilitates cross-border data exchange, which is particularly beneficial for countries with close economic ties. The X-Road federation between Estonia and Finland allows for interoperability between their data exchange layers yet supports a complete interdependence between their economies. The federated data exchange smooths public service provision to citizens, workers, and entrepreneurs operating across borders. 02. Trust through impeccable security, transparency and equitable use of personal data X-Road’s impact goes beyond service delivery—it has become a foundation for trust between citizens and the state. When services are provided proactively, without requiring citizens to request them, efficiency becomes a trust-building tool. By ensuring individuals receive benefits and services as soon as they become eligible, X-Road plays a crucial role in shaping a more responsive and citizen-centric government. Beyond automation, X-Road has redefined transparency, accountability and the equitable use of personal data in digital governance. By unifying data exchange with X-Road, Estonia also introduced a data tracker that allows citizens to see who has accessed their personal data and for what purpose, enhancing transparency and control. This mechanism strengthens public trust by making errors and potential misuse both visible and reportable. Each transaction within the X-Road ecosystem is timestamped, cryptographically signed, and logged to ensure integrity while preserving privacy—no log data is shared with the governing entity, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure while tampering of the logs is made impossible. Only metadata (header) is collected and published as open data, with query and response content remaining private between the parties. The open-source nature of X-Road further reinforces trust, allowing independent verification of its security and functionality. 03. Sustainable interoperability X-Road plays a vital role in promoting sustainability by allowing governments to optimize resource use and enable secure, efficient data exchange with energy-efficient infrastructure. By reducing the need for dedicated, resource-intensive private networks and leveraging existing public Internet infrastructure, X-Road minimizes redundancy and enhances resource utilization across multiple stakeholders. Cloud-based Security Servers (software components acting as access points to the X-Road ecosystem) can further improve X-Road’s sustainability by reducing energy consumption by up to 88 per cent compared to on-premises solutions, benefiting from efficient resource allocation and energy-efficient data centres. Since X-Road is a cloud-ready solution, organizations can seamlessly transition to cloud environments to enhance both environmental and operational efficiency. With a long-term vision of becoming the world’s most sustainable data exchange solution of its kind, X-Road aims to align with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support eco-friendly digital transformation. 04. The public sector digitalization landscape The adoption of X-Road has accelerated Estonia’s public sector digitalization efforts by providing a consistent framework that simplifies system integration and addresses complex technical challenges such as secure data exchange, encryption, and audit trails. By using X-Road as the primary integration channel, development teams can save significant time by reusing a proven solution for data exchange. X-Road also strengthens security, compliance, and resilience by providing a comprehensive framework that aligns with industry best practices, including Zero Trust principles and data integrity assurance. Furthermore, it fosters innovation by simplifying collaboration across software teams, allowing them to focus on impactful solutions while providing access to shared services and interoperable solutions that promote partnerships between government agencies and private sector stakeholders. 05. Data sovereignty X-Road ensures strong data sovereignty by employing a decentralized architecture that allows organizations to retain full control over their data and data access services. Every information system owner operates through a dedicated access point component—an X-Road Security Server—preserving sovereignty and enforcing strict access controls. Government entities maintain ownership of their data while defining who can access it and under what conditions, reinforcing security and autonomy. This approach also eliminates reliance on central intermediaries, as data is transferred directly between the data provider and the consumer. The end-to-end encryption mechanism guarantees that data remains confidential and accessible only to its intended recipient, enhancing security and trust. X-Road allows organizations to retain full control over their data exchange while ensuring compliance with both national and international data protection laws. Ultimately, this decentralized and secure model strengthens digital autonomy while fostering seamless and reliable data interoperability. 06. Cyber resilience X-Road enhances cyber resilience through a combination of proven security measures—such as encryption and digital signing—alongside decentralized architecture and continuous security evaluations. Over several decades, X-Road’s security framework has successfully withstood numerous widespread cyber-attacks in Estonia, demonstrating its reliability and robustness. By leveraging X-Road’s established security foundation, development teams can focus on their core objectives without the burden of building security measures from scratch. To ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats, commercial cybersecurity specialists regularly assess the X-Road software through comprehensive evaluations, including architecture reviews, threat modelling, and penetration testing. A public bug bounty program further enhances X-Road’s security by ensuring continuous improvement and resilience. 07. Digital Public Goods The Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) provides X-Road as an open-source solution to support global digital development and promote equal access to digital infrastructure. X-Road is vetted by the Digital Public Goods Alliance to ensure it fulfils the criteria of a Digital Public Good. The NIIS has also cultivated an active international community of users and engineers, facilitating knowledge sharing and offering ongoing support to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the X-Road software worldwide. By fostering the open-source ethos, X-Road helps create a more inclusive and accessible digital environment. Governments leveraging X-Road are already benefiting from its collaborative development model.

Tailored solutions for your unique needs More efficient space utilization - achieving savings on fixed costs by increasing utilization rates and consolidating An organization needs premises in order to provide physical service delivery. With current practices, the utilization rates of office spaces often remain significantly low which creates costs in terms of excess space capacity and insufficient service production. Space resource management helps in reserving the right space for service delivery and the smooth functioning of a professional's work, as well as in organizing space reservations into a cohesive whole. Our solution integrates appointment data, optimizes room allocations based on factors like doctor movement, and seamlessly syncs results with Outlook calendars, using HL7 FHIR standard interfaces. The solution can be integrated with patient information systems, facility services, and other background systems. Personnel resource allocation planning – the cornerstone of efficient service delivery In industries where service delivery requires professionals with a variety of different skills and qualifications, an unnecessary amount of time and effort is spent on planning. Processes can be fragmented, and manual, and rely on the specialized knowledge and expertise of individual people. We have co-developed with our customers a solution utilizing MS Power Platform and Azure platforms. The benefits of the solution lie in centralized data management, where everyone can see the information according to their user role needs. Shared information flows through the system from one stage of the process to the next, reducing manual work and errors combined with the usage of historical data used as a basis for plans and for developing operations. Process automation in an industrial environment A manufacturing client suffered from a very manual, and therefore slow and error-prone, purchase order processing system which required manual conversion and data en try to an ERP system. To speed up and automate the process we did a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Proof of Concept (PoC) project to evaluate the compatibility of Microsoft Power Automate with Oracle EBS and assess the feasibility and benefits of automating our customer’s order creation process. Product m arketing data m anagement solution One of our manufacturing customers had an outdated system that was burdensome to manage, with manual steps and slow adaptation to changes.

Armando Zulian ServiceNow Business Leader Carlos Lopez ServiceNow Studio Leader ServiceNow FAQ What is ServiceNow software and how can it h elp my business? ServiceNow CRM is a powerful platform that helps organizations streamline workflows, automate tasks, and improve service delivery across departments like IT, HR, and customer service. At Nortal, we help you identify where and how the ServiceNow platform can make the biggest impact on your organization through our envisioning and roadmap service. How do I get started with low-code on the ServiceNow platform? If you’re looking to build applications or automate processes without writing code, ServiceNow CRM’s low-code tools are a great place to start. Our ServiceNow experts guide you through the entire journey - from identifying the best use cases to planning and execution. How do I know if my current ServiceNow setup is working properly?

Our health check service ( hyperlink back up to software services) gives you a comprehensive analysis of your setup to help you find gaps and improve user experience.

Nortal’s end-to-end consulting and implementation ensures speed, quality, and alignment with your goals. What are the most common mistakes companies make with ServiceNow software ? Common issues include poor planning, low user adoption, and underutilizing automation features. O ur health check service helps you catch and fix these early. What is the difference between ITOM and ITSM? While both are strategies for IT management, ITOM and ITSM are separate concepts. ITOM describes the individual processes and services that are administered by an IT department—this includes administrative processes, support for hardware and software, and services for internal and external clients. On the other hand, ITSM includes what a company does to manage IT services through the entirety of the life cycle, including strategic planning, service operation, service desk, continual service improvement, and design building. ITSM also encompasses the help desk and fulfilment of IT requests that come from employees. Best practices of ITSM are known as the ITIL framework, which describes the life cycle of service in detail. ITOM is covered under the ITIL framework. ITOM teams are meant to focus on daily tasks for the operation of an organization’s infrastructure components and applications—all aspects of the service operation stage defined in the ITSM lifecycle.",

Atlassian tools enable teams to plan projects, transfer knowledge, and track tasks. The big advantage is that the products are highly scalable and therefore suitable for both small and large organizations. Atlassian tools can also be integrated with many third-party providers. Other reasons for choosing the Atlassian product range include time-saving automation, centralization of information, and high security standards. Why does Nortal partner with Atlassian? The partnership between Nortal and Atlassian brings together the best of both worlds: Atlassian's powerful products and Nortal's expertise in implementation, configuration, and integration. How long does it take to implement Atlassian software? The duration of implementation depends heavily on individual requirements. With cloud implementation, standard setups and smaller teams can get started within a few days, while complex projects with self-hosted solutions and strict security requirements can take several weeks to months. How does the integration of Atlassian tools with existing systems work? Atlassian tools can be integrated with existing systems via already-active interfaces and Marketplace apps. Tools such as Microsoft Teams offer connectors for Atlassian products, while Atlassian provides APIs. Plugins from the Atlassian Marketplace enable connections to customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, for example. What licensing models does Atlassian offer? Atlassian offers two main licensing models: Cloud and Data Center. While the Atlassian-hosted Cloud solution is more suitable for companies that want quick implementation and easy setup, the self-hosted Data Center option is ideal for organizations that require advanced security features and must adhere to strict compliance guidelines. What technical skills does our team need to manage Atlassian products? Basic IT skills and tool-specific knowledge are required to manage Atlassian products. Knowledge of workflow and process management as well as cloud hosting is an advantage, and basic knowledge of scripting languages can also be useful. At Nortal , we always aim to transfer knowledge and want to enable you to use Atlassian tools profitably. Are Atlassian tools GDPR compliant? Yes, Atlassian tools are GDPR compliant. Atlassian implements strict data protection and security measures, including data encryption, user control, and audit functions. For cloud users, data can be stored in GDPR-compliant data centers. These features are also available for most third-party Marketplace apps. Our Atlassian experts can help you review and configure your tools and apps for compliance. How can we measure the ROI of Atlassian software? There are several ways to measure the ROI of Atlassian software: You can analyze the time savings achieved through automation or compare operating costs with those before Atlassian products were introduced. Employee satisfaction, which is strongly influenced by workflows and team communication, can also be an indicator .",

Oman e-Census 2020 is a great example of how technology can accelerate public services. The award was received by Dr. Khalifa bin Abdullah al Barwani, the CEO of NCSI, during a ceremony held on 6 May 2024 under the auspices of HH Shaikh Meshaal al Ahmad al Jaber al Sabah, the Emir of the State of Kuwait. During the acceptance, Dr. Barwani spotlighted the efforts that the NCSI has made in recent years to digitally transform national statistics to support decision-making. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff during the previous population count in 2010. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Read the story in the Oman Observer A fully register-based census In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts.

While technology promises faster, more efficient and more adaptive public institutions, it also raises risks of over-centralization, weakened accountability and “digital authoritarianism.” Government efficiency and democratic principles are not competing goals. Instead, when designed intentionally, digital government can and should embed democratic values, such as participation, transparency, competition, subsidiarity, accountability and inclusion, directly into its architecture, creating nations that are both more efficient and more democratic. The paper proposes whole-of-government system-level efficiency as an important benchmark for public sector performance. System-level efficiency consists of operational efficiency, state capacity and public trust. These outcomes are constrained by four cross-cutting factors: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. Short-term efficiency achieved by centralization may erode resilience and trust, while federated and modular systems, though more complex, foster adaptability and long-term performance. Democracy itself is shown to be the most system-efficient governance model: its design principles – representation, accountability, pluralism, subsidiarity, checks and balances and shared civic identity – optimize outcomes and use of resources across multiple functions simultaneously against the maximum potential. Translated into digital government, these principles guide choices around open standards, federated data architectures, algorithmic transparency and citizen participation, in turn optimizing for long-term system-level efficiency. The core thesis of this paper is thus: In pursuit of government efficiency through technology, the policy and technological decisions we make in designing the digital government are in fact steering us more toward a digital democracy or digital autocracy. In optimizing for long-term efficiency against maximum potential, we must in fact turn to democratic principles and implement them in digital government. In doing so, we not only increase government efficiency but also reinforce democracy. The paper outlines a three-stage roadmap toward efficient digital democracy: 1. Build a secure and trusted foundation – with base registries, digital identity, federated data exchange and transparency tools to give citizens visibility and control over data use. If implemented right, it sets a strong democratic, equitable and efficient foundation for government. 2. Increase intelligence in government systems and services – horizontally and vertically integrating domains to move toward proactive and agentic service delivery while balancing deterministic automation with AI. 3. Prepare for digital democracy and cyberocratic governance – a model of “rule by information” that leverages real-time data and AI for policymaking while reinforcing, not eroding, democratic accountability, oversight and participation. Democratic processes must also evolve and adapt to these new capabilities. Our conclusion is that governments can leverage technologies and become more efficient without compromising the fundamental values of democracy. In fact, as we have argued, those democratic principles are themselves drivers of long-term efficiency and performance. A digital government built on these foundations will not only achieve better outcomes – it will also strengthen the democratic fabric, ensuring that efficiency gains endure and benefit government and society as a whole. 7 Introduction 2. 8 As governments adopt increasingly capable AI-based systems, nations and the bureaucratic organizations that run them will be fundamentally transformed. The emerging era of AI-enabled governments will be defined by a growth in the creation and usage of data, increasing levels of automation, and run the risk of increasing the distance felt between governments and the governed. What this future looks like, and whether these governments will be more authoritarian or democratic, remains to be seen. But both futures are plausible. A decade from now, citizens will live inside the digital institutions we are designing and building today – the choices made today matter and will influence which future prevails. We believe in the importance of a strong, digital and democratic future. That is why, in this paper, we argue and show that government efficiency and democratic principles are not in conflict. In fact, when democratic principles are properly operationalized, they lead to greater system-wide efficiency. Principles such as transparency, auditability, participation, collaboration, competition and decentralization are essential for delivering better services, strengthening state capacity and deepening public trust. However, these aims are only achievable if architecture is treated as policy, and policy as architecture. The responsibility for building more robust, resilient and democratic digital systems, therefore, lies not only with ministers or rule-makers but also with CIOs, CTOs, CDOs, product owners and system architects. The code they approve, the standards they establish and the contracts they sign will influence institutions toward either openness or control, competition or monopoly, growth or stagnation. These are political choices, often disguised as purely technical decisions. As these diverse groups of stakeholders collaborate to shape the future of AI-enabled governments, it is crucial to avoid shortcuts and the temptation of highly centralized systems that, outwardly, seem more efficient. Such an approach might produce quick results, but in the long run, these systems are likely to fail. Not only are centralized systems less robust, but they also erode the trust necessary for supporting continued legitimate democratic governance. Instead, governments should support systems that are distributed and self-organizing, governed by clear standards and shared values. This involves adopting open standards instead of proprietary single-vendor solutions to foster market competition; integrating auditability and explainability into systems and algorithms to ensure accountability; facilitating open and inclusive participation channels; and federating data and services so that decisions occur at the lowest effective level. None of this suggests being naive about AI. Governments should automate deterministically where legal frameworks and data quality permit, applying AI thoughtfully in contexts where pattern recognition, scale or complexity surpass human capabilities. Human in the loop by default, well-documented models and data provenance, transparency of data processing, human control over their data, algorithmic transparency and independent oversight are not optional extras; they are essential for legitimacy at scale. In the following sections of this report, we define government efficiency and provide an overview of how democratic principles drive excellence in digital architecture and service design. The report then provides a roadmap for building efficient digital democracies: (1) build a secure, trusted foundation (e.g., base registries, digital identity, once-only data exchange); (2) increase intelligence and responsiveness across information systems and services (from common standards to agentic, self- organizing models); and (3) prepare for cyberocratic governance – governance by information that remains firmly under the rule of law. Finally, the report offers key recommendations for putting these principles into practice. 9 Government efficiency and democratic principles 3. 10 Whole-of-government system-level efficiency Operational efficiency Improving the internal performance of government operations and service delivery. This means achieving more output or higher quality services, with the same or fewer resources. Examples include faster processing times, reduced administrative costs, streamlined user journeys and less paperwork for citizens, companies and civil servants. Operational efficiency often represents the most visible early gain from digital transformation, but by itself it is insufficient. State capacity (effectiveness) Enhancing the government’s ability to design, implement and enforce policies and core functions. State capacity refers to the government’s ability to collect revenue, maintain rule of law, deliver public goods and respond to societal needs. Technology can strengthen state capacity by improving data quality for decision making, improving coordination among agencies, and enabling proactive and preventive interventions. Strong state capacity allows government to translate policy into tangible outcomes. Public trust Strengthening citizens’ trust in government by improving transparency, integrity and user experience. Trust is both an outcome and a critical enabler of government efficiency: high-trust environments make policy implementation easier and encourages citizen cooperation, improves voluntary compliance and lowers transaction costs. Without trust, even the most technically efficient systems risk underperformance or public resistance. Across eras, governments turn to new tools to solve recurring problems: seeing society clearly, coordinating action, moving resources and securing borders. Each wave – from roads and censuses to the telegraph, electrification, digitalization and today’s AI – cuts transaction costs, speeds decisions and extends government’s reach and capacity, making services cheaper and more predictable at home while signaling reliability and competitiveness abroad. Adoption typically accelerates under crisis, fiscal pressure or strategic rivalry, when not adopting becomes costlier than change. Governments embrace technology chiefly to do more with less (operational efficiency), have more impact in doing so (state capacity) and to earn and sustain public trust: 3.1 Achieving progress in all these areas simultaneously – operational efficiency, state capacity and public trust – is what we refer to as system-level efficiency of governance, which must be evaluated against their maximum potential (e.g. is the system of governance maximizing use of resources and individuals and society to its maximum potential). Thus, we define the purpose of government system-level efficiency to maximize the use of resources and individuals for the benefit of the society as a whole. To achieve system-level efficiency, these three facets must be interrelated. For example, operational efficiencies can free resources that improve services (bolstering both effectiveness and 11 Complexity As government systems and processes grow complexity, complicatedness becomes the enemy of efficiency. Complexity itself is not the problem per se, but complicatedness. Highly complicated, fragmented processes and systems are harder to change or improve, and they increase the risk of failures. Simplifying processes, using modular architectures, and focusing on interoperability standards are strategies to tame complexity. If complexity is not (self-)managed, it reduces all outcomes – making efficiency gains harder, undermining reliability (effectiveness) and frustrating users (eroding trust). Thus, a successful digital government must continuously pursue reduction of complicatedness and introduce principles that enable self-organization into the system. Resilience This refers to the ability of government to withstand shocks and continue operating under adverse conditions – be it cyberattacks, natural disasters or sudden surges in demand (like a pandemic). Efficiency measures must not come at the expense of resilience. Centralizing infrastructure might be short- term efficient, but it can create single points of failure; conversely, distributed systems may be more resilient but harder to govern. A resilient digital government is adaptive to changing circumstances through strategically managing supply chain risks, technology options, policies and threats so that it can perform even under extraordinary circumstances. Resilience contributes to public trust (people know services will be there in a crisis) and to state capacity (the government can manage during emergencies). Sustainability Governments must balance short-term wins with long-term sustainability. This has two aspects: financial sustainability (avoiding projects that create unsustainable maintenance costs or technical debt) and policy sustainability (ensuring that digital reforms support long-term goals like inclusiveness and environmental sustainability). Launching a system that is not maintainable, lacks public satisfaction); meanwhile, maintaining public trust requires that efficiency gains are achieved without sacrificing accountability or equity. High-performing digital governments, such as those in some EU countries, often track a portfolio of KPIs across these dimensions. Each project or policy should articulate which of these outcomes it advances and how that will be measured. For instance, a digital service project might primarily improve efficiency (faster responses) and potentially trust (better service experience), whereas a data-sharing initiative between law enforcement and courts might target effectiveness (higher conviction rates, quicker justice). Importantly, pursuing the three above mentioned outcomes is not without challenges. Four strategic concerns often shape the success or failure of digital initiatives: complexity, resilience, sustainability and digital sovereignty. These concerns act as cross-cutting constraints or considerations: 12 Any government digitalization policy or program should be justifiable in terms of system-level efficiency outcomes (operational efficiency, state capacity, public trust) – while explicitly addressing these strategic concerns (complexity, resilience, sustainability, sovereignty). A proposal that cannot articulate how it improves at least one key outcome is likely not a good use of public resources. Likewise, if a digital initiative undermines resilience (e.g., creating a single point of failure) or sovereignty (e.g., making critical systems dependend on an unaccountable external provider), it carries hidden costs and risks that must be weighed. By using these outcomes and concerns as evaluation criteria, policymakers can have more structured debates about digital investments. Notably, pursuing all outcomes and minimizing all risks simultaneously can be challenging – there will be trade-offs. For example, maximizing operational efficiency through extreme centralization might undermine resilience or public trust. Efficiency and resilience might conflict in highly complex systems (Artime 2024), governing complex systems itself prescribes more complex guidance, evaluation and coordination systems (Schünemann et al 2024, Yang et al 2024). Therefore, finding the right balance and looking for mechanisms that achieve this through self-organization is key. The key questions then shift from what needs to be achieved to how it can be achieved. How can we move from striving for local efficiencies in a policy domain or core government function, to achieving global system-level efficiency across all government functions? Next, we turn to this question by examining a system that delivers better performance across all functions, achieves higher system efficiency than others, and at the same time manages complexity, resilience, sustainability and sovereignty — democracy. staff with the right skills or is misaligned with a wider service strategy could yield a short-term boost but undermine capacity in the long run. Similarly, focusing only on near-term KPIs might neglect crucial long-term investments (like digital literacy or legacy system modernization). Policymakers should evaluate how each technology decision affects future flexibility and costs. Sustainable digital transformation often means incremental, user-centered improvements that can be built upon, rather than one-off “silver bullets.” Digital sovereignty Means having control over one’s own systems, policies and their outcomes – including control over data, third-party risk, technical infrastructure and the rules that govern them. For a nation, this translates to balancing external technological dependencies and cost, ensuring data is stored and processed in line with national laws, and retaining the ability to change and adapt systems without being “locked in”. Digital sovereignty is linked to state capacity (a sovereign digital state can implement policy without external interference) and resilience (less risk from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical tech restrictions). It can also influence trust, as citizens may trust digital services more if they know those services are governed by their own democratic laws rather than opaque global algorithms. 13 Figure 1: Example of typical socio-technical tensions that governments are navigating. System-level efficiency of democracy A (whole-of-government) system-level efficiency described earlier can result from many so-called functional forms, i.e., the institutions supporting the main functions of a society, which deliver health care, education, wellbeing and other key demands and rights citizens are entitled to. What truly makes a difference is, however, how all those functions are optimized simultaneously. We argue that this can only happen in a self-organizing system when there are key principles in place which interdependently ensure that the system optimizes over all of them. As defined above, we understand system-level efficiency as something that makes sure all the functions are performed either excellently or above average in conjunction. Achieving this is certainly not easy as it should happen at the system-level. As governments modernize through information technology (including AI), they repeatedly encounter fundamental tensions in how subsystems are designed and governed. These tensions, shown in Figure 1, represent opposing principles or approaches – each with its own advantages and risks. Should we maximize control to ensure safety and force uptake of single pieces of technology, or should we rely on trust-driven exchanges and voluntary uptake of the best technology that emerges? Should we aim for full automation for efficiency or allow for human decision-making which allows for creativity and effectiveness? Do we value privacy so much that we are willing to trade it for the fairness that transparency enforces? Do we want centralized authorities for streamlined controlled processes, or do we want federated approaches which ensure this through checks and balances, mutual dependencies and market-based mechanisms? 3.2 14 The technology choices made between the opposite poles of the dimensions profoundly influence policy outcomes and the risk of societal harm or benefit. We need to be aware that technology choices made today bring downstream consequences and path dependencies that can be overcome only at great cost. Conway’s Law famously states that “any organization that designs a system will produce a design that mirrors the organization’s communication structure” (Conway 1968). In other words, the way we organize governance (centralized vs decentralized, privacy vs transparency) will be reflected in how our IT systems are structured. This means that digital government architectures, intentionally or not, end up encoding the values and structure of the government that built them. This also works the other way around – technological choices influence organization and governance, e.g., if we design a centralized system, it has good likelihood to produce organization structures and forms of governance that will consolidate power. This puts tremendous responsibility for people designing digital government and related policies, as in fact, they are also designing our society and form of governance. It also drives home the point that we must have clear principles guiding technology choices, rather than fixating on the technologies themselves. If we step back and look from a systems perspective, certain principles have stood the test of time in ensuring system-level efficiency by balancing these tensions. We need not look far – we are living in such a system through democratic political order. In principle almost 2,500 years old, and in its modern form a bit more than 200 years in the making, democratic systems clearly outperform other models in system-level efficiency, at least in delivering the functions people universally value. There is plenty of empirical evidence backing this up with hard numbers. Though highly centralized (authoritarian) systems might outperform democracies at some functions under specific conditions, there is overwhelming evidence that when it comes to the most crucial dimensions, such as economic wellbeing, happiness, health and education in conjunction, democracies outperform other regimes. Democracies provide better health care and higher population health levels (Patterson & Veenstra 2016, Franco et al 2004, Besley & Kudamatsu 2006, Kudamatsu 2012), democracies ensure higher welfare and happiness and lower poverty levels (Flavin 2024, Paleologou 2022, Dörffel & Freytag 2023), democracies educate their populations better and more effectively (Dahlum & Knutsen 2017, Apergis 2018, Brown 1999), democracies excel at science (Whetsell 2021) and provide higher, more sustained economic growth (Acemoglu et al 2019, Di & Huang 2023). Figure 2: As per Conway’s law, organizational structures and technological architectures mirror each other. 15 In other words, democracies are system-level efficient at higher rates than other political regimes, optimizing the use of resources and collective outputs in relation to their maximum potential. This does not mean they outperform in providing every function, but they do certainly outperform when looking at all those functions jointly. What are the core principles of a democratic system that lead to system-level efficiency? Let’s examine them briefly. Volumes have been written on what constitutes democracy and the forms it can take, but there is a consensus on certain key principles that characterize such a system: 1. Representation and participation. A democracy allows citizens to participate in decision-making either directly or through regularly elected representatives. Free and autonomous individuals can decide what’s best for themselves, and by engaging in joint direct decision-making or elections this becomes a collective will. This principle ensures that all interested parties have a say. It also reinforces the next principle, accountability. 2. Transparency and accountability. A democratic system must be transparent to ensure accountability of elected officials and appointed professionals. Accountability means there are mechanisms to hold those entrusted with power responsible for their actions. This principle ensures that those with power act in the interest of their ultimate principals: the citizens. 3. Pluralism (competition). No system is truly democratic without regular competition of ideas and actors. Competition ensures the best ideas thrive and are accepted based on merit. This principle allows innovation in the system and, through systematic trial and error, ensures that ideas with the potential to improve society are identified and adopted. 4. Subsidiarity and self-organization. A democratic system values subsidiarity, i.e., the rule that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level, allowing communities to self-organize. Self-organization allows communities and interest groups to act autonomously since they know what works best for them. It is also the ultimate efficiency rule: a self-organizing system needs low overhead (less central control) and tends to have the lowest transaction costs in interactions. 5. Checks and balances. There must be safeguards to ensure power is not concentrated unchecked, and that different institutions can limit each other’s power. Such an equilibrium ensures that abuses of power are rare and can be corrected collectively when detected. 6. Shared civic identity and social cohesion. Despite each actor and individual in the system having their own interests, there is a shared common identity (civic or national) that ensures social cohesion. This shared identity means that while we differ as individuals and groups, we play by the same set of rules as citizens, and those joint rules are valued in themselves. Together, implementing these principles ensures that the system self-optimizes at a higher level across all central government functions. The exact institutional setup might differ substantially between democracies (parliamentary vs. presidential systems, for example), but what matters is their functional equivalence. The specific electoral system matters less than whether it is free, fair and regular. Similarly, the particular accountability mechanisms a society chooses are secondary to the fact that functioning accountability exists in practice. 16 Implications to digital government How are these principles relevant for digital government? The answer becomes clear by looking at them: If these principles have allowed us to build and govern complex societies while continuously improving living standards, then they must not only work well – they should be transferable and broadly applicable to yield the same effect in other contexts. In other words, when applied to designing a digital government or state information system, these principles help optimize the efficiency of the system-as-a-whole. Applying democratic principles to digital design makes the democratic system itself more resilient, effectively perpetuating democracy in the digital realm. This implies that government digitalization ultimately makes democracy stronger, because good digitalization is essentially an emulation of democracy’s core principles. Next, we argue how these democratic principles impact digital government architecture and highlight which efficiency outcome(s) each principle most strongly impacts. 3.3 17 Democratic principle Implications for digital government architecture Primary impact on Representation and participation – Government reflects the will and diversity of the people. Ensure digital accessibility for everyone regardless of their skills or impairments; design algorithms and interfaces to avoid bias and exclusion. Trust Transparency and accountability – Officials are accountable for their actions. Make systems and algorithms auditable and transparent. For example, provide public audit trails and open data on automated decisions. Clearly communicate what data the government collects, the legal basis for its use, and offer traceability and oversight for data sharing between agencies. Trust Pluralism (competition) – No monopoly of power; ideas compete on merit. Prefer open standards over monolithic proprietary solutions. Architectures should favor an ecosystem of interoperable modules with functional equivalence, avoiding any monopolistic technology structures that lock in one vendor or approach. State capacity and operational efficiency Subsidiarity and self- organization – Decisions made at the lowest effective level. Use a federated system architecture. Decentralize systems horizontally (across functions) and vertically (across levels of government), avoiding unnecessary concentration of power in a single authority. This distributed design mirrors democratic decentralization. State capacity and operational efficiency Checks and balances – Power is limited and monitored by others. Enforce segregation of duties in IT systems and data governance. Limit authorities’ access to data and systems strictly to their defined mission to prevent mission creep. Implement oversight mechanisms for algorithms (e.g., requiring approval for any automated decision rules that affect rights). Trust and operational efficiency Shared civic identity and cohesion – A unifying sense of equal citizenship. Allow autonomous service delivery by different providers (including voluntary civic tech) but enforce universal interoperability standards. Provide universal access by giving every citizen equal access to digital services via a common secure digital identity and shared channels. Trust and state capacity Table 1: Democratic principles, their implications for digital government architecture, and their highest-impact efficiency outcomes. 18 Adopting democratic principles in digital government is both necessary and feasible and through strategic technological choices these principles can improve government efficiency systematically across functions. These principles call for thoughtful alignment of governance values with system architecture – from ensuring representation through inclusive platforms, to baking in accountability through transparency features, to structuring systems in a decentralized way that mirrors distributed power. When done right, digital government will strengthen democracy, making institutions more responsive, inclusive and resilient. Figure 3: Framework to build efficient digital governments using democratic principles. The next part of this paper translates these principles into an actionable roadmap, outlining how countries at various stages of digital maturity can progress toward cyberocratic governance (governance by information) in a controlled, value-preserving way. 19 Roadmap to efficient digital democracy 4. 20 To translate these principles into practice, we can identify key stages of technology adoption in government and highlight fundamental phases and decision points that significantly affect the journey. The stages can be summarized as follows: Secure and trusted foundation for digital government Establish the base digital infrastructure: core registries and databases, unique identifiers, digital identity for citizens, secure data exchange mechanisms and other digital public infrastructure (for example, digital payment systems). This stage focuses on getting the fundamentals right and offers opportunities to significantly increase efficiency. However, it also demands foundational choices that can either solidify democratic principles or erode them. Rise of intelligence in government systems and services Once foundational systems are in place, governments turn to improving policy outcomes within specific sectors. In this stage, advanced digital governments gradually move toward citizen-centric, whole-of-government service delivery – breaking down silos between agencies so that services can be delivered seamlessly. The outcome is significantly increased effectiveness and citizen satisfaction in each major domain (health, justice, finance, etc.), as well as new policy insights from pooled data (Haug et al. 2023). In this stage, governments also encounter new choices about how to uphold democratic principles amid emerging technologies. Nations that execute this well develop a highly trusted and efficient digital government. They will prioritize data governance and have a highly developed data valuation culture, gaining new data-driven policy insights for better governance. Cyberocratic governance and the future of democracy in the age of AI At the most advanced stage, government leverages high-quality data and AI to make governance more adaptive and predictive – essentially “rule by information,” or cyberocracy (Ronfeldt & Varda 2008). Policies can be adjusted in real time based on data (while preserving human oversight), and government incorporates more direct citizen input (potentially adopting elements of direct democracy through digital tools). This stage envisions governance that is not only efficient and personalized for the citizens but also continuously participatory – a blend of data-driven administration (OECD 2019) with active civic engagement, all under strong rule-of-law frameworks and technologically realized citizen control. Governments entering the cyberocratic era face a crucial fork: will their digital state evolve as a digital democracy or veer into digital autocracy? In the following sections, we look at these stages in more detail, examining the choices and implications at each stage. 01. 02. 03. 21 Secure and trusted foundation to digital government 4.1.1. Base registries and the once-only principle Base registries are authoritative public databases that serve as the single source of truth for core information about persons, organizations, assets and locations. They underpin efficient governance and service delivery by providing legal legitimacy to records (acting as trust anchors for data on individuals, businesses, properties, etc.). Because many services rely on these foundational datasets, base registries must be high- quality and broadly accessible (European Commission 2018). This prevents each agency from keeping its own redundant records – such as parallel lists of citizens or companies – and ensures all parts of government use a shared, trusted source. Crucially, base registries should be kept institutionally and legally separate to maintain proper checks and balances. Consolidating all vital data under one authority will inevitably lead to mission creep. Instead, different ministries or agencies each manage a different registry. Data sharing between them is permitted only when necessary and under clear legal rules. Many countries embed such rules in law (stipulating which authorities can access which data and for what purpose) and establish secure data- exchange systems accordingly. For example, Estonia designates certain registries as official sources and requires all agencies to use them rather than collect data anew. This federated model prevents undue concentration of power and mission creep (even if unintentional). Federation can occur both horizontally and vertically – systems can be federated across functions (e.g., separate population and commercial registries) and across levels of government (local/ municipal, regional/state, federal). This also reinforces the democratic principles of self-organization and subsidiarity. Because base registries are widely used, data quality must be rigorously managed – any error can quickly spread across services. For this reason, base registries are often best operated by organizations that provide public services related to those registries, allowing data to be corrected as part of natural business operations. This approach also reduces complexity and improves sustainability. Federation of registries and systems further increases resilience – if executed well, failures or risks in one system do not necessarily propagate to others, improving the security and reliability of the entire digital government. Another important design goal is to minimize the number of different identification numbers in use across government. Ideally, each person has one unique personal ID, and each company has one unique business ID, used for all interactions with public services. Wherever possible, governments aim to implement unified identifiers. Estonia, for example, uses one national ID number for nearly all services. If a single ID scheme is not feasible, interoperability strategies can cross-reference multiple IDs for the same person or entity. Notably, basic identifiers like a national ID code or business registration number 4.1 22 should be treated as non-secret public information to facilitate verification, whereas the personal data associated with those IDs remains protected. Simply knowing someone’s ID number must not compromise their privacy, because any access to the actual personal records still requires proper authentication through the secure digital identity system. Interconnecting base registries is a foundational step toward true digital government. They provide common identifiers and reference data that all other systems can rely on. This dramatically boosts efficiency and improves public satisfaction by reducing repetitive paperwork. Once information is recorded in a base registry, government services can retrieve and reuse it whenever needed, rather than repeatedly asking citizens to supply the same details. Reusing data in this way also builds trust, as people see that the government is not continually asking for information it already has. This practice of reusing information is known as the once-only principle – citizens and businesses should have to provide standard information only once, after which government systems share it internally (with necessary consent or legal authority) instead of asking again. The once-only principle in practice hinges on the availability of comprehensive and trusted base registries. If those registries exist and are kept accurate, any government agency can query them to obtain needed information instead of bothering the citizen. For example, when someone applies for a pension, the system can automatically pull the person’s birth date and identity details from the national population register (instead of requiring a birth certificate), check employment history from tax or social security records, verify the current address from the address register and so forth. All of this happens behind the scenes without the individual having to resubmit data that the government already holds. When each component is interoperable, such end-to- end services become seamless and largely automatic, significantly improving the user experience. Progress toward these foundational goals can be measured with clear success metrics. One key indicator is a reduction in duplicate data requests to citizens. For instance, Estonia tracks how many times data are shared between systems instead of asking a citizen to provide it; each such instance is counted as an application of the once-only principle, and a steadily rising count signals improvement. Another indicator is the adoption of common data standards and classifications across government (so that all agencies are “speaking the same language” when referring to countries, regions, businesses, medical terms and so on.). Investing early in shared code lists and taxonomies – such as a master list of government agencies with unique identifiers – pays off later by simplifying integrations and reducing errors. Next, we look at digital public infrastructure, which enables the once-only principle and other efficiencies. 23 4.1.2. National digital public infrastructure Practically implementing the once-only principle requires using data across government via secure infrastructure. Every interaction between systems must be trusted. It must be clear who is requesting or updating data, that the exchange is legally permitted, and that no unauthorized changes or leaks occur. Addressing these trust and security requirements is the role of digital public infrastructure (DPI). If implemented correctly, DPI also forms the first and most important layer of cyber defense (in effect implementing a nationwide zero-trust architecture), significantly lowering cybersecurity threats and costs across the public sector. Core components of a secure and trusted DPI include: Digital identity and e-signatures A high-assurance digital identity and e-signature system for all residents (as well as for legal entities and even government systems) is fundamental to providing government services online in a legally binding way. This must be backed by laws that recognize digital identity and signatures as equivalent to physical ones. Together, these enable the elimination of most paper documents and credentials, paving the way for significant efficiency gains across the entire economy. For example, Estonia’s government calculates that digital identity and e-signatures save at least 2% of GDP annually. The design choices for digital identity have a paramount impact on society: with proper checks and balances (a design where the citizen controls the use of their identity), digital identity can enable significant efficiency gains that fuel further trust. However, if the system identifies citizens without giving them control (e.g., using pervasive biometrics without consent), it invites abuse; a system without strong safeguards will eventually erode effectiveness and outcomes. Federated data exchange system A federated, real-time data exchange network that links information systems in a secure way. Through this exchange layer, data remain in their original source systems and are provided to others on demand, transaction by transaction. All data requests and transfers should be end-to-end encrypted and authenticated, meaning only authorized systems and users can retrieve certain data (with full auditability for accountability and transparency). Domain-specific data exchange networks (e.g., for e-payments or e-invoicing) also fall in this category. A globally notable example is the X-Road platform for secure government interoperability – enabling data exchange horizontally (across agencies), vertically (across levels of government) and even across borders. Data wallets and verifiable credentials In addition to system-to-system real-time data exchanges, personal data wallets provide an alternative way for individuals to hold and selectively use their own verified credentials. For instance, instead of an employer having to verify an applicant’s degree via a government database, the applicant could directly share a verifiable digital diploma from their personal data wallet. These wallets give users more control over their information and offer an alternative channel for data exchange – useful if automated interoperability between systems is unavailable or undesired. Personal data wallets embody principles of participation, subsidiarity and resilience by giving citizens more personal control over their data and reducing dependence on central systems. 24 Single digital gateways One-stop-shop portals or applications that provide a unified front door to government services. A single digital gateway (often implemented as a government one-stop-shop or a mobile “super-app”) allows users to access a wide range of services from different agencies through one consistent interface. These gateways might operate at the national level or be specialized by sector or region, but in all cases, they simplify user interactions by aggregating services on one platform. Single digital gateways implement the principles of shared civic identity and participation. They do, however, need to balance choices between centralization and federation to provide the best service experience without concentrating too much control. Sovereign clouds These are cloud computing environments for government or public use that ensure government control over computing and data. Importantly, a sovereign cloud strategy should avoid concentrating risk in a single cloud provider. Instead, a system of clouds (potentially a mix of private and public clouds meeting sovereign requirements) can improve resilience, strengthen digital sovereignty and enhance cost-efficiency for digital government – especially if competitiveness principles are included (avoiding vendor lock-in and encouraging multiple solutions). All these components work in concert toward the same goal: delivering efficient digital services in a secure and trusted manner. In effect, the digital infrastructure must serve as both an enabler and a gatekeeper for digital government. It enables seamless data flows and service automation, while simultaneously acting as a gatekeeper that enforces privacy, security and proper use of data. International initiatives such as the UN’s DPI Safeguards provide comprehensive guidance on built-in safeguards for such infrastructure. It is also important how DPI itself is organized and provided. DPI should enable effective digital government functions while avoiding a new concentration of power and control. In other words, DPI itself must not become a single, monolithic system – it should remain competitive and modular. DPI must allow incorporation and interoperability of different systems and technologies through common standards, rather than enforcing a single technology solution. For example, instead of mandating one specific digital identity solution or one “sovereign cloud” technical stack, government should provide interoperable standards and institutional mechanisms to procure and operate multiple competing solutions from public or private sectors. This approach upholds the principles of participation, competition and self- organization – fundamental drivers of both democracy and overall government efficiency. 25 4.1.3. Transparency and public trust in personal data usage No matter how advanced the technology, a digital government can only function with the consent and confidence of its people. Thus, the trustworthiness of the digital public infrastructure itself must be beyond reproach. One way to bolster public trust is to build transparency and personal control into data practices by giving each citizen a clear view of, and control over, how their data are used by the government – a sort of accessible “digital twin” of the citizen’s government- held identity and records. This can be provided through a dedicated public service or portal. Through such a service, individuals can see which government agencies have accessed their personal data, what data were accessed and when. They can also review what information is on file about themselves and, in some cases, correct any inaccuracies. Estonia’s national e-portal and government mobile app, for instance, include a Personal Data Tracker tool that lets residents see every query made on their personal records. This level of transparency is now seen as vital to maintaining public trust in government data use. Empowering citizens in this way creates a virtuous cycle linking transparency, trust and better outcomes. When people have real-time insight and control over their data, they are more likely to trust digital services. Greater trust leads to higher adoption and use of e-services, which in turn boosts administrative efficiency and compliance – since more interactions flow through streamlined digital channels and citizens are more likely to provide accurate information. Transparency breeds further trust: it drives uptake and cooperation, generates more data for improvements and thereby reinforces trust. This, in sum, is the social contract of digital government – citizens are willing to allow the use of personal data in return for efficient service outcomes, as long as they have visibility and agency in that exchange. Figure 4: Personal data tracker in a government super app. 26 A telling measure of a nation’s digital public infrastructure – and the trust it has built – is whether core democratic exercises, such as general elections, can be conducted online securely and with high public confidence. Secure internet-based voting for national elections remains rare globally, but Estonia has successfully provided it at scale. Estonia first introduced nationwide online voting in 2005, leveraging its advanced digital identity and data exchange infrastructure to authenticate voters and protect the integrity of the ballot. Thanks to the robust design of its DPI, the system has never been compromised, even though Estonia has been a major target of nation-scale cyberattacks since 2007. The constant external threats have, in fact, been a key driver for building high resilience and security into the system. By 2023, the popularity of the online voting had grown to the point that more than 50% of all votes in Estonia’s parliamentary elections were cast online – exceeding the number of paper ballots for the first time. This outcome reflects a remarkable level of public trust in the country’s digital government systems. Few other countries have ventured to implement internet voting on a large scale, precisely because the security and transparency requirements are so stringent. To be viable, an e-voting system must ensure end-to-end integrity: every step from voter authentication and authorization to ballot submission, encryption, secure storage and accurate tallying of votes must be protected and verifiable. Strict oversight is essential – independent audits and verification mechanisms must ensure results are credible. Estonia’s experience suggests that when a digital ecosystem is mature and citizens have seen its benefits over many years, they are more willing to accept even fundamental civic processes going online. The benefits of online voting include greater democratic accessibility and participation (citizens can cast their vote securely from anywhere) and potentially higher turnout. At the same time, a parallel paper voting option is maintained to ensure inclusivity and public confidence for those less comfortable with digital methods. With strong online voting practice in place and with wide adoption, democratic processes can be conducted more cost-effectively and more frequently. This not only reinforces democratic practices but also enables new forms of civil participations, which we analyze further in later chapters. By implementing these foundational elements, governments establish an efficient and trusted base for digital government while also reinforcing democracy. Even nations at an early digital stage can leapfrog by focusing on these fundamentals. With a secure foundation in place, governments can next turn to leveraging shared data and emerging technologies (such as AI) to further transform public service delivery and outcomes. Case study: Online voting as a benchmark for trust and resilience in digital public infrastructure 27 Rise of intelligence in government systems and services With strong digital government foundations and safeguards in place, governments can shift focus to improving domain-specific outcomes. This next stage moves beyond digitalizing siloed services – agencies begin to collaborate across traditional boundaries to deliver integrated, citizen-centric services. In this stage, the information networks and data flows within government systems begin to rise in intelligence. We see both vertical integration within sectors (connecting all key actors in, for example, the healthcare or justice sector) and horizontal integration across related sectors (for example, linking social services with employment services, since outcomes in one affect the other). The result is more proactive, personalized services in each domain, improved efficiency and outcome metrics (e.g., faster case resolution in justice or better care coordination in health) and a richer pool of information for policy insights within each domain. This in turn leads to higher overall government efficiency. However, in this stage, governments also start to navigate difficult choices about how new data flows challenge old institutional structures, and they must balance short-term gains with long-term governance principles. 4.2.1. Government information systems and super-domains National information ecosystems consist of the networks, standards and organizations that enable data and information to flow seamlessly across government, businesses and society. At this stage, each major policy domain (justice, health, public finance, education, social protection, transportation, land use, etc.) becomes a digitally coherent environment where data, information, and knowledge flow seamlessly among relevant actors in real time. The primary purpose of these integrated ecosystems is to improve sector-specific outcomes. Below are some examples of domain-specific national information ecosystems, the key entities involved, and the benefits achieved: 4.2 28 Integrates data across police, prosecutors, courts, prisons, probation services and even victim support organizations. This connectivity enables faster, fairer justice. Links hospitals, primary care clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, emergency medical services and health insurers/national health funds. The outcome is better patient results and efficiency. Connects tax authorities, customs, the statistics office, social security administration, banks, business registries. This yields higher revenue collection and efficiency, and less administrative burden for entrepreneurs. Richer real-time economic data becomes available for better- informed policymaking. Brings together local planning offices, cadastre and land registries, building regulators, environmental agencies and utilities. The result is quicker permits and smarter development. A unified digital permitting portal and shared land data make approval processes faster and decisions more informed and transparent. Speeding up permits accelerates housing construction and infrastructure projects, boosting economic activity. Integrates social benefit agencies, public employment services, education/training providers, child protection agencies. This enables faster service delivery and improves social outcomes. Links 911/112 emergency call centers with police, fire departments, ambulance services, disaster management agencies and even sensor networks (e.g., weather or earthquake sensors). The result is improved emergency response. Connects intelligence agencies, law enforcement, border control, cybersecurity centers and international intelligence partners. With appropriate safeguards, this ecosystem leads to prevented threats and faster investigations and significantly improves a country’s ability to anticipate and respond to security risks. Justice (criminal justice chain) Healthcare Public finance and real-time economy Land and urban planning Social services Public safety and emergency response Security and intelligence (national security) 29 Each example shows how integrating data and processes within a domain translates into improved outcomes – faster justice, better health or greater safety. Each step up the maturity ladder brings greater efficiency and effectiveness, which in turn enables more advanced and citizen-focused service delivery in these domains. Achieving a high-maturity information exchange requires progressing from basic, context-agnostic data sharing (basic interoperability that aims to achieve once-only data-sharing between registers) to rich, context-aware information sharing and ultimately knowledge exchange. At each stage, the depth of interoperability increases – common semantic standards (such as shared taxonomies and ontologies) ensure that data is not only transmitted but also understood in context. In essence, standards serve as a common language, allowing different systems and organizations to exchange data meaningfully rather than just technically. As the ecosystem matures, stakeholders adopt common data standards and models so that information carries explicit meaning across systems. Here, data exchange becomes true information exchange – data are augmented with standard definitions and metadata that make their context understandable to any authorized receiver. This is achieved by implementing shared taxonomies or data dictionaries that define each data element consistently across the domain. Using standardized taxonomies makes data self-describing, enabling semantic interoperability within that domain (the data’s meaning is preserved across systems). Many domain-specific standards emerge at this stage. For example, in healthcare the HL7/FHIR standards define common formats and codes for exchanging patient records, lab results, medications, etc., so all hospitals and clinics interpret the data the same way. In finance, the XBRL standard allows businesses and regulators to share financial reports with a common understanding. By using such standards and taxonomies, there is far less need for manual data mapping or guesswork – the meaning itself “travels” with the data. The most advanced stage moves beyond exchanging structured information into exchanging knowledge (semantic interoperability with ontologies). At this maturity level, government information systems don’t just share data with agreed meanings; they integrate reasoning, relationships and insights derived from that information. Multiple taxonomies can be linked under a common ontology – effectively uniting various domain vocabularies into an interoperable whole. For example, an ontology might incorporate a healthcare taxonomy, a pharmaceuticals taxonomy and a geographic taxonomy, enabling knowledge to be shared meaningfully across medicine and location (such as tracking a disease outbreak by place). This enables parties to ask complex questions or discover insights that weren’t possible at the basic information level. An ontology provides a shared context model that computers can use to infer new information and ensure unambiguous interpretation across domains. While a taxonomy might list and categorize, say, medical terms or legal concepts, an ontology describes how those concepts relate (e.g., understanding that Diabetes is a type of Chronic Disease, so if a patient has diabetes, the system can infer that the patient has a chronic condition even if not explicitly stated). Knowledge exchange is enabled by technologies like knowledge graphs, reasoning engines and linked data standards. A well-known example is the Google Knowledge Graph, which aggregates facts about people, places and things from many sources and uses 30 ontologies to integrate multiple taxonomies and data feeds into a cohesive graph of knowledge. This allows, for instance, a query that spans domains or infers relationships across datasets. Generally, ontologies and knowledge graphs act as a “contract for meaning” so that all parties share the same understanding of concepts and relationships. Together, they enable a knowledge-driven information ecosystem or super- domain where machines can understand context, detect patterns and even draw basic inferences from shared data. Crucially, each step up this maturity ladder brings greater efficiency and intelligence to the ecosystem. Higher semantic interoperability means less ambiguity, less manual intervention and more reuse of data and services across government. It also helps to reduce complexity and makes decisions more understandable and transparent, which invites more participation and oversight. At each stage, the depth of interoperability increases – data is not only transmitted, but understood in context. 31 4.2.2. New public service delivery models and institutional reforms Having richer information flows and stronger interoperability opens the door to fundamentally improved public service delivery models. As digital public infrastructure and standards mature, governments have been moving beyond basic transactional e-government portals toward services that are personalized, proactive and citizen-centric. Rather than forcing people to navigate complex bureaucratic structures, the idea is for government to assemble what each person needs, when they need it, across organizational boundaries. Service delivery is evolving to become anticipatory and seamlessly integrated into citizens’ lives. For many years, a flagship approach to this vision has been the “life-event” service model. Life-event services (for example, “Having a child,” “Starting a business” or “Retirement”) bundle multiple agencies’ services and requirements into one unified, end-to- end journey for the user. Done well, life-event services eliminate duplicate data requests (honoring the once- only principle so that citizens don’t have to provide the same information twice), reduce the time to achieve an outcome, and build public trust through a more user-friendly experience. In principle, a citizen entering a life-event portal provides their information once, and the government handles the behind-the-scenes coordination across departments. However, implementing real life-event services (not just describing how they work, but integrating all these digital services into a unified whole) has proven notoriously difficult. It requires intense cross- agency governance and cooperation: clarity on who “owns” the service or life-event process, agreements on shared funding and service-level agreements, harmonization of rules and processes across agencies, and often new legal bases for data sharing. Many ambitious life-event programs have stalled not due to technology, but because of institutional and policy frictions – agencies may struggle to agree on responsibilities, funding or data-sharing rules. The coordination overhead is high, and negotiating every detail of a complex life-event can take years. This opens the door to a key policy choice for mature digital governments: now that we have data flows that do not neatly follow traditional institutional structures, should we rethink institutional boundaries and structures for efficiency? Many institutional reforms, such as merging tax and customs administrations for better coordination on VAT and excise taxes, are linked to efficiency gains. However, proper checks Now that we have data flows that do not neatly follow traditional institutional structures, should we rethink institutional boundaries and structures for efficiency? 32 Figure 5: Self-organizing, agent-driven and proactive services in a government super app. and balances are crucial to ensure that in pursuing efficiency we do not unnecessarily consolidate power in ways that undermine democratic principles or public trust. An alternative route – one better aligned with the democratic principles of subsidiarity and decentralization – is now emerging as self-organizing services with agentic-driven AI. In this model, instead of pre-defining every cross-agency service bundle and assigning a single agency “owner,” the government focuses on exposing secure, standardized capabilities as APIs (for example: verify identity, check eligibility, fetch a citizen’s civil status, validate a permit, issue a payment or schedule an appointment). This approach shifts the burden of integration from the institutional layer to the service layer. Instead of agencies needing to negotiate upfront who owns an entire life-event process, agencies simply agree to provide certain capabilities under common standards and governance. The agentic service layer – which could manifest as a government super-app, a digital assistant or third-party apps – stitches together the necessary steps in real time. The outcome for the citizen is the same or better level of personalization, proactivity and convenience that a life-event service would promise but achieved with fewer structural bottlenecks behind the scenes. Essentially, the user interacts with one smart interface that can handle many tasks proactively. To enable self-organizing, agent-driven services at scale, governments must have robust digital infrastructure and standards in place. Key enablers 33 include high-quality authoritative data, common data models, and semantic interoperability across agencies (so that an agent can understand and use information from multiple sources). Equally important are well- defined service APIs for core functions, available for trusted internal or external use and an event-driven architecture that allows systems to react to changes in real time (for example, a change in a citizen’s status automatically triggers relevant updates or services). With self-organized services, services become significantly more proactive and adaptive. Instead of reactive, one-size-fits-all processes, the government can deliver support that is tailored and timely for each individual’s context. For government organizations, the focus shifts to owning and excelling in capabilities – ensuring high-quality data, reliable APIs and clear rules encoded as software – rather than trying to manage every possible end-to-end customer journey themselves. Cross-agency agreements and governance also evolve: the question is no longer “Who owns this entire life-event service?” but “Who ensures that each underlying capability is delivered reliably and securely?” Each agency or product team takes responsibility for the performance of the capabilities it provides, treating them as critical products. Oversight bodies and regulators, in turn, focus on the outcomes and ensure that when AI agents are involved, they operate transparently, safely and without bias. For instance, audits shift to examining how an AI agent used data and why it made certain decisions on a citizen’s behalf, rather than evaluating only human case handling. All this builds upon the concept of government-as- a-platform: the government provides foundational building blocks and various service providers or even intelligent agents can innovate on top of them. For example, a private-sector company might build a more user-friendly mobile interface for a government service or personal digital assistants could interact with government APIs to get things done for users – all within the policy and security frameworks set by government. Self-organizing, agentic public services are a prime example of using the right technology in the right way to deliver public value and improve efficiency. Next, we further analyze the use of AI in government and how it can enhance efficiency when applied responsibly. 34 Service model Service logic Citizen effort Strengths Limits Traditional digital services Citizen initiates separate applications per agency; point-to- point workflows. Medium. The citizen must search, re-enter data and repeat submissions (still better than physical paperwork or phone calls). Simple to build and manage; low coordination costs between agencies. Fragmented experience; duplicate data entry; slower outcomes; risk of exclusion for some users. Proactive services Government initiates service based on known events/data (e.g., a benefit offer triggered by a life event). Very low. Citizen only needs to confirm and consent, if anything. Inclusive and fast; builds trust; once- only principle fully applied within scope. Limited to well- defined events; requires solid legal bases and very accurate data. Life-event service bundles Pre-designed end-to-end journeys for major life events. Low. A single entry point and bundled steps for the user. Holistic, intuitive service; measures outcomes across agencies. Hard to scale across all life events; high institutional coordination needed; disputes over ownership and funding. Self- organizing agentic services AI agents compose capabilities dynamically per context and can be conversational or event-driven. Potentially lowest. Largely assistive (prefilled, guided interactions; the citizen can opt out if desired). Highly personalized and adaptive; spans multiple domains; avoids many institutional bottlenecks. Requires very mature DPI and standards; transparency, bias mitigation and safety must be engineered by design. Table 2: Comparison of public service delivery models – traditional digital services, proactive services, life-event bundles and self-organizing agentic services. 35 Rule-based (deterministic) automation applies predefined logic to well-structured inputs and will, given the same conditions, always produce the same outcome. If the rules and data inputs are known and complete, the process is entirely predictable. This predictability makes rule-based systems transparent and straightforward to audit, because one can trace every decision to an explicit rule or law. In essence, these systems encode the application of policy or legislation into software. They excel at tasks that are repetitive, standardized and grounded in clear criteria. AI or machine learning (non-deterministic) automation involves systems that learn patterns from data (including unstructured or incomplete data like free-text documents, images or sensor feeds) and make probabilistic inferences or predictions. Rather than following fixed if- then rules, AI models recognize complex patterns and correlations to estimate outcomes (e.g., the likelihood of fraud, the classification of a document, a prediction of service demand). This is valuable when not all decision criteria can be exhaustively specified in advance, or when the volume of data to analyze is massive. AI systems can adapt and improve as they process more data, but their decision logic is implicit in the model and not a simple set of human-readable rules. 4.2.3. Automation in government: deterministic vs. AI systems Technology should always serve outcomes, not the other way around. As emphasized earlier, no tool – AI included – should be adopted for its own sake. The case for deploying any advanced automation must rest on clearly defined problems to be solved and measurable public value to be gained, balanced against well-understood risks (such as bias, opacity or erosion of privacy). In this context, government leaders should view artificial intelligence as one part of a broad automation toolkit, to be used only where appropriate and effective. Government agencies can draw on a spectrum of automation approaches ranging from deterministic, rule-based systems to non-deterministic AI systems. The difference lies in how each handles information and reaches decisions: 01. 02. 36 In government – which fundamentally operates based on laws and rules – deterministic automation should remain the first priority wherever possible. Rule-based systems are the right choice wherever processes are well-understood, repetitive and clearly defined by legislation or policy. Examples include calculating eligibility for benefits using established formulas, performing routine financial reconciliations, processing standard permit applications or integrating records between systems. In these cases, data can be structured and decision logic explicitly defined and explained when needed. Rule-based automation delivers speed and accuracy at scale, ensures consistency (equal treatment under the same rules) and is inherently auditable. In effect, it allows government to execute laws and policies quickly and reliably through digital systems. AI, on the other hand, is most useful in situations where tasks cannot be fully specified upfront or involve recognition of complex patterns beyond human capacity. This includes scenarios like detecting anomalies or fraud across millions of transactions, analyzing unstructured data (scanning vast numbers of documents, emails or images for relevant information), or providing predictive analytics and decision support. For example, AI might be used to triage cases in a social services or justice system to prioritize those needing urgent attention, or to forecast public health or social care needs. In such settings, AI’s value is not just doing things faster – it can enable entirely new capabilities that were not feasible with manual or rules-based methods alone. For instance, an AI model might analyze thousands of benefit applications and automatically approve the simple, low-risk cases (with explanations logged), freeing up human caseworkers to focus on more complex ones. Or a machine learning system could monitor real-time data from city infrastructure to predict and prevent failures before they happen. These are tasks where a static set of rules either cannot be written to cover all nuances or would be too rigid to adapt to new patterns. Both rule-based and AI-driven approaches can significantly improve performance, but in different ways. Rule-based deterministic automation streamlines well-defined processes – for example, compressing a task that once took a clerk 30 minutes into a few seconds of automated processing, and doing so with near-zero error rate. Multiplied across thousands of transactions, the time and cost savings are enormous, and every decision can be traced back to a clear rule (maintaining transparency). AI, by contrast, removes analytical bottlenecks – it can review millions of records or continuous data streams far faster than any team of human analysts, surfacing risks or insights (fraud patterns, public health trends, etc.) that neither rules nor humans might catch in time. Used well, AI augments human decision-making and enables earlier, better-targeted interventions, whether it’s preventing waste and abuse or delivering services to those who will benefit most. However, efficiency and innovation must not come at the expense of legitimacy and public trust. If an AI system’s decision process cannot be explained or audited, it should not be deployed at scale in government services without a human in the loop. This is not more than we ask from human public servants – freedom in action with transparency and adherence to regulations, or strict supervision. In areas where AI is necessary to achieve effectiveness (because no other solution can reasonably handle the complexity or volume), governments must secure transparency and accountability through other means. This includes adopting a human-in-the-loop design for important decisions – ensuring that human officials remain responsible for final judgments that affect individuals’ 37 rights or entitlements, and that they can override or question the AI’s suggestions. Clear boundaries should be established delineating where an AI may assist or prioritize cases and where only rule-based or human decision-making will apply (especially for decisions with legal or ethical consequences). Moreover, operational transparency is critical: government authorities must document their AI models, data sources and validation processes; log the AI’s actions and recommendations; and be prepared to provide meaningful explanations to both citizens and auditors about how a decision was made. This might also mean providing an audit trail that shows which data influenced an AI recommendation or giving an individual a simplified explanation for why they were flagged by an algorithm. Governments can capture the benefits of both traditional automation and AI while upholding democratic values by applying the right tool to the right problem. Deterministic, rule-based automation should be used to encode the transparent application of law and policy wherever data is well-structured and rules are clear. This not only speeds up current services but also reinforces fairness and accountability. AI should be deployed judiciously – only where it genuinely adds value, such as making sense of patterns in large, unstructured datasets or adapting to new trends – and always within a framework of human oversight, auditability and privacy protection. The success of this stage (enhanced intelligence in services) becomes visible to citizens in everyday life: quicker services, fewer forms to fill out and a sense that the government knows them and helps them without endless red tape. It also sets the stage for the next evolution: leveraging real-time data and AI not just to improve services, but to transform governance itself into a more adaptive, responsive system – the realm of cyberocratic governance. 38 Future of democracy in the age of AI With data and information increasingly available and accessible for strategic policymaking and operational decision-making, we are approaching the limits of our current governance model. The vision of evidence-informed, adaptive governance is encapsulated in the idea of cyberocracy (Ronfeldt & Varda 2008) – a system where governance is deeply integrated with real-time data and algorithmic tools. The key distinction between democratic cyberocracy and digital authoritarianism lies in whether democratic values and public accountability to guide the use of these technologies. We must ask: can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? 4.3 39 4.3.1. Cyberocracy and the evolution of digital democracy In a cyberocratic government, the feedback loop between citizen needs, data and policy is significantly accelerated. Traditional governance often relies on periodic statistics, delayed reports and infrequent elections to adjust course. Cyberocracy implies real-time sensing of and reaction to events. For example, consider crisis management: if a natural disaster strikes, a fully integrated government can sense the impact (through sensors, social media signals, emergency calls) in real time and coordinate a response across agencies instantly, dynamically reallocating resources as data on needs comes in. We saw glimpses of this during the COVID-19 pandemic – some countries leveraged near-real- time data on cases, hospital capacity and mobility to inform their policies (for instance, adjusting lockdown measures or vaccine distribution on the fly). A cyberocratic future would generalize this capability: whether it is an economic shock, a public health issue or an environmental threat, governments could respond with agility unheard of in the past, using data-driven simulations and AI to weigh options quickly. Policies themselves could become more conditional and adaptive – for example, a tax policy might automatically adjust rates for certain sectors if indicators show those sectors are struggling, rather than waiting for the next year’s budget law. However, real-time policymaking pushes against the limits of current democratic processes. Democracies are built on deliberation and due process, which take time. If decisions become very rapid, how do we ensure accountability and public input? One possibility is that as data empowers faster executive action, there must be commensurate strengthening of oversight, such as AI tools aiding legislators or requirements that any algorithmic decision rule be transparent and approved by elected officials beforehand. Another aspect is direct citizen participation in real time – perhaps through more frequent digital referenda or citizen votes on issues, enabled by secure e-voting technology. If policies can change week to week based on data, could citizen feedback be gathered as frequently? In Switzerland, referendums every few months are routine; with digital tech, one could theoretically consult citizens much more often. There are risks of decision fatigue or populism if such mechanisms are not designed carefully. Still, we may see democratic innovations like online citizen assemblies or crowdsourced policy proposals operating continuously alongside data-driven administration. One intermediate approach is the concept of liquid democracy or delegated voting, where people can delegate their vote on specific issues to trusted experts and reclaim it at any time. Digital voting platforms (building on secure e-voting infrastructure) can enable such flexible representation. The “experts” in this scenario might even include specifically vetted AI models that can represent a citizen’s interests in very specialized policy domains (AI-augmented) – potentially much more knowledgeably than another human could. This remains hypothetical, but it aligns with cyberocracy’s need to combine expertise with broad participation. 40 Another dimension is the information sphere for citizens. In a cyberocratic era, highly available, high- quality information – and tools to make sense of it – will be crucial for meaningful citizen participation. If governance becomes very complex and data- heavy, average citizens could feel left behind without concerted efforts in civic education and user-friendly transparency tools. We can imagine AI-powered interfaces that help explain policies to people in personalized ways. For example, a citizen could ask, “How will the proposed city budget affect me?” and an AI assistant (drawing on government data) could produce a personalized, easy-to-understand answer. Presenting complex information in accessible forms (data visualizations, interactive simulators, personalized summaries) would improve citizen participation by making people better informed and able to see evidence behind the decisions. For instance, if a local government is considering a new traffic policy, a public online simulator might allow any resident to tweak parameters (like closing a street or changing bus frequency) and see the projected impact on congestion or emissions. Engaging citizens in data-driven exploration makes public debates more fact-based. Empirically, when citizens are given unbiased information and tools to understand it, deliberations tend to yield more moderate, consensus- oriented solutions rather than polarized ones. Thus, investing in open data and explanatory tools becomes a democratic imperative in cyberocracy. We must ask: can real-time data and AI improve public service delivery and citizen engagement, or will these tools concentrate power, reduce transparency and erode fundamental rights? 41 4.3.2. Cyberocratic policymaking We must also address the role of AI in policymaking itself. As AI models become more prevalent, they will be used to generate policy options, predict outcomes or make certain administrative decisions automatically. This raises a provocative question: if an AI system significantly influences policy, how do we ensure it aligns with human values and democratic choice? One approach is that if AI inherently involves judgments or biases (as any model trained on human data might), then perhaps citizens or their representatives should “vote” on which AI systems or which parameter settings to use for important decisions. For instance, if an algorithm is used to prioritize infrastructure projects, its criteria (e.g., economic return vs. helping disadvantaged areas) reflect value judgments – those should be democratically determined, not left to engineers or opaque algorithms. Governments or markets might present multiple AI-generated recommendations and have a public consultation or an expert citizens’ jury choose among them. The key point is that algorithmic governance requires oversight. Many jurisdictions are already moving toward this: the EU’s proposed AI Act would classify government AI systems that affect people’s rights as “high-risk,” subjecting them to audits and transparency requirements. Ultimately, maintaining human agency is vital. Cyberocracy should not mean abdicating decisions to black box AI without accountability; it means using AI smartly as a tool for human decision-makers and citizens. In terms of policy co-creation, cyberocracy could enable more of a wiki government approach: policies posted online in draft form for continuous citizen input, with potentially thousands of contributions analyzed (by AI) to improve the proposals. This could become standard: before a government finalizes a major regulation, it runs an online deliberation where any citizen or stakeholder can contribute. Arguments are mapped and rated, often with AI helping to find common ground or summarize themes, and the results inform the final decision. It’s slower than purely top-down decision-making, but perhaps faster than traditional committee processes, and it can produce legitimacy that top-down approaches cannot. For a democratic cyberocracy, we might also see the emergence of algorithmic jurisprudence – where legal rules are at least partly encoded into automated systems. For example, tax formulas could be directly implemented so that taxes are calculated and adjusted in real time with economic changes (indeed, some aspects already are, such as inflation- indexed benefits). However, legal interpretation and value trade-offs will still require human judgment and democratic debate. We may find that parliaments need new technical advisory units to help them write laws that can be implemented in code without ambiguity. Figure 6: Realtime information and AI facilitated policymaking will require to accelerate democratic processes. 42 43 4.3.3. Impact on politics, elections and freedom Another aspect to consider is the impact on politics and elections themselves. If governance becomes more continuous and based on performance data, political accountability is likely to shift. Voters may expect real-time results and become more impatient with leaders – or conversely, data transparency could help build trust if it shows genuine improvements. The availability of high-quality live data on government performance (e.g., dashboards for crime rates, school performance, hospital wait times) and on the projected impacts of proposed policies might influence public opinion and election outcomes – for better (more accountability and informed debate) or worse (data misinterpretation or hyper-fragmented messaging). In a best-case scenario, a well-informed electorate could base decisions more on track records and less on rhetoric. But there is also the danger of information overload or the misuse of big data for micro-targeted propaganda, as we have already seen in recent years. Ensuring that quality information is available to all, and not just to some, will be crucial. Efforts to combat disinformation will be even more important in a cyberocracy – without trust in information, the whole model collapses. As Freedom House and others have documented, the past decade has shown how digital tools can spread propaganda and erode democracy in many places. A democratic cyberocracy will need strong institutions to ensure truthful, evidence-based discourse – potentially including public broadcasters with mandates to explain data clearly, educational curricula emphasizing data literacy, and swift responses to false information online. Cyberocratic governance holds great promise for democracies if done right. It could mean governments that respond to citizen needs instantly, policies that continuously improve based on evidence, and citizens who are deeply informed and engaged in the governing process. Cyberocracy can be more efficient at monitoring and managing complexity than bureaucracy and technocracy have been. However, it also comes with serious risks that must be managed: surveillance creep, loss of privacy, algorithmic bias, erosion of deliberative processes and the specter of authoritarian abuse of these technologies. We may lose the very meaning and fabric of our society and culture if we get this wrong. The difference between a digital democracy and a digital dictatorship will hinge on safeguards, transparency and empowerment. In a democracy, cyberocracy must empower citizens – giving them more information and voice – rather than merely surveilling or nudging them without consent. It must also preserve human dignity and agency, ensuring that behind all the data, individuals are treated fairly and that decisions can be appealed or corrected. The technologies involved are value-neutral; it is our implementation that determines the outcome. If we adhere to the principles discussed, the future can be one in which technology greatly enhances democracy. If we ignore those principles, we may slide into what some call “digital authoritarianism,” where the state uses technology to control and manipulate – a scenario already visible in some countries. The future of democracy in the cyberocratic era will depend on a grand bargain: citizens trust government with a lot of data, and in return government becomes more transparent, accountable and responsive. The best outcome is a virtuous cycle where informed 44 citizens and data-informed officials co-create policy in near-real-time, leading to effective solutions to societal problems – all while upholding fundamental rights. Achieving this will require continuous vigilance: new institutions, such as data ethics councils, algorithm auditors, participatory platforms, and possibly new rights, such as data ownership rights and rights to explanation for AI decisions, will need to be established. But if done well, cyberocracy could revitalize democracy for the 21st century. Figure 7: Whole-of-government system-level efficiency framework with a path to democratic cyberocracy. 45 Conclusion and key recommendations 5. 46 In earlier chapters, we outlined what constitutes system-level efficiency and what constrains its achievement. We looked at how one system – democracy – has achieved high levels of system efficiency and identified the core principles of democracy that contribute to that success by design. We also mapped these principles onto key information system design decisions. Then we showed how these design decisions can be implemented in practice through technology, and what implications this has for the governance of societies. Now we will sum up the macro-level implications. One way to visualize the argument is with two triangles: one standing upright and one inverted. The choices made at the foundational layers (the base of the triangle) determine the freedoms and efficiencies at the top. Figure 8: System design principles leading to different levels of efficiency and freedom. 47 In a democracy designed with bottom-up principles, freedoms widen toward the top because the system is set up to allow maximum choice and autonomy by design. In a digital dictatorship, by deliberate design, power is concentrated at the top – leading to fewer freedoms and less capacity for self-organization. The result is low system efficiency, even if such a regime may achieve strong operational efficiency in some isolated domains. In short, a choice to centralize may feel secure at first but it will reduce the room for action later and is never a basis for a self-organizing, resilient ecosystem. If you centralize your architecture and decision-making, you maximize control and dependency, stifling competition and innovation; eventually, at the very top – where policy choices and service designs are made – there will be far less freedom or flexibility. In an overly centralized model, the CTO effectively becomes the de facto CEO of government. Modern democracies do not look like that. Their freedoms widen at the top rather than narrow, because the system is built to allow for maximum freedom and choice from the bottom up through the core principles that govern us. A digital dictatorship, however, narrows freedoms at the top: a deliberate decision to centralize will concentrate power and inevitably lead to fewer choices and less self-organization capacity. What are the implications? The first is that our digital government leaders – and the technical and policy decisions they make – will shape how our government and society look in the future. Not immediately, but over time, as each layer of technology and policy is built on the last. Unfortunately, we will only fully know the consequences in hindsight. However, as discussed earlier, we can emulate systems that have stood the test of time – democracies – and aim for system efficiency that is complex yet still self-organizing. Or simply, we can copy what works. 48 Key recommendations Governments must adopt technology to increase public-sector efficiency and deliver greater public value. In doing so, they will need to navigate policy choices that affect the design of digital government. Thesis of this paper is that these same design and policy choices determine (or strongly influence) the form of governance itself. In optimizing system-level (whole-of- government) efficiency, democratic principles drive government efficiency – because those principles fundamentally lead to better performance at scale. The key recommendations are: Embed core democratic principles into digital transformation and initiatives Treat the principles of participation, transparency, competition, subsidiarity, accountability, and civic inclusion as design criteria for digital initiatives. Ensure a variety of service delivery channels and use the ones people prefer (participation); mandate transparency of algorithms and decisions; prefer interoperable, competitive solutions over monolithic ones; push decision-making authority and data ownership to the local or individual level whenever effective (subsidiarity); enforce checks and balances in data governance and system access; and ensure every citizen can access digital services (through inclusive design and assistive measures). By aligning technology projects with these democratic principles, governments not only improve performance but also reinforce public trust and legitimacy. Build a secure, trusted digital foundation with democratic safeguards Invest in high-quality base registries, unique identifiers for people and businesses, secure data exchange (interoperability) infrastructure, and universal digital identity with e-signatures. Ensure legal and institutional checks and balances in this foundational infrastructure so that no single authority can abuse concentrated data or power. This foundation should emphasize privacy, security and transparency by design to build public trust from the ground up. Manage complexity, resilience and sovereignty proactively Embed organizational goals to simplify processes and legacy systems wherever possible to reduce complexity. Use modular architectures and open standards to make 01. 02. 03. 49 systems adaptable and interoperable. Incorporate resilience strategies (redundancy, decentralization of critical systems, contingency planning) so that services withstand shocks and cyber threats. Prioritize digital sovereignty for critical systems – adopt open-source or multiple-vendor solutions to avoid lock-in, and ensure critical data and systems remain under national or democratic control. Build horizontal and vertical integration across domains using same principles. Deliver citizen-centric, integrated services (personalized and proactive) Redesign services around life events or user needs, minimizing the burden on citizens. Implement the once-only principle so that citizens and businesses never have to provide the same information twice. Strive for single front-door access to services (one-stop portals or apps) and proactive service delivery (where the government initiates or pre-fills services when data indicates a need). Ensure that integration of services across agencies doesn’t erode accountability: maintain clear ownership of data and functions and use legal frameworks to enable responsible data sharing and leverage emerging technologies such as self-organizing agentic services where applicable. Focus on user experience and inclusiveness across all channels (web, mobile and in person) to boost adoption and satisfaction. Apply automation and AI responsibly, with humans in the loop Use rule-based automation as the default for well-defined, rule-based processes – this improves speed, consistency and transparency in service delivery. Deploy AI or machine learning tools only where they add clear value (e.g., detecting patterns in large datasets, providing predictive insights) that cannot be achieved with simpler and more transparent means. For all AI deployments, implement strong accountability measures: human oversight for critical decisions, explainability requirements, audit logs, and regular bias evaluations. In other words, treat AI as an assistant to human officials and citizens, not a replacement – maintaining the primacy of human judgment, especially in critical decisions affecting rights or entitlements. By following these recommendations, governments can modernize and become more efficient without compromising the fundamental values of democracy. In fact, as we have argued, those democratic principles are themselves drivers of long-term efficiency and performance. A digital government built on these foundations will not only achieve better outcomes – it will also strengthen the democratic fabric, ensuring that efficiency gains endure and benefit government and society as a whole. 04. 05. 50 6.

    "content": "Case study May 5, 2025 Data-driven solution for safer and smarter operations at Valmet After a fire caused a data loss in a test facility, Valmet committed to ensuring that no valuable test data would be at risk again. Through a pioneering partnership with Nortal, Valmet merged Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) to create a customized, resilient, data-driven solution that prioritizes safety and efficiency. This project is part of a larger initiative under Valmet’s Factory IT program, a new strategic focus area designed to enable business excellence through modular capabilities and a scalable, extendable IT service offering for factory operations. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Data and AI Valmet, a leading global developer and supplier of process technologies, automation, and services for the pulp, paper, and energy industries, ensures quality by rigorously testing its products in a precise testing environment equipped with hundreds of condition monitoring sensors. Valmet’s test bench has significantly more product-specific sensors than those found on the customer’s factory floor, ensuring product quality. A few years ago, a fire broke out at the Valmet Rautpohja factory in Finland during a roll test, destroying one of the test rigs used for testing paper machine rolls (SymRoll). Fires during roll testing are extremely rare, but in such uncommon situations it is important to ensure that test data is recovered to a safe location and easily accessible. “Back then, we stored local data near the operator’s room, and we weren’t able to save all our test run data,” says Timo Ollila , Product Manager, Deflection compensated rolls, Board and Paper Mills Business Unit, Valmet. “With our old system, only data about the last test runs was available, and not easily accessible either.” Capturing crucial data from roll test runs The test environment is an accurate and data critical environment, where accurate data collection is non-negotiable. Every sensor measurement and video feed are vital to understanding performance and ensuring safety. It’s in this environment where data concerning sensors, roll inspection, startup recipes, and video needs to be collected, captured, and transmitted to the cloud. Because any data that isn’t in the cloud is at risk of not being able to be efficiently analyzed. Timo Ollila’s brief to Nortal had three requirements: Valmet needed to collect accurate data and keep it in a safe place. The data needed to be available, meaning visible, visualizable, and not complicated to get. Valmet wanted a suite of tools that would deliver tangible business value to Valmet and enable them to effectively leverage their data. Valmet’s pioneering solution in the heavy industry Nortal’s Cloud Architect Anssi Pannula and the rest of the team set to work to develop an IT/OT integration using the latest technologies. “Our solution collects data from the new test rig at the Rautpohja factory using 3,000 sensor tags that measure temperature, speed, pressure, flow and vibration, among many others” says Pannula, “and all of it is sent to Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric in near real time. Video is captured by four cameras, and all footage is stored in OneLake in Microsoft Fabric. With OneLake File Explorer, users can easily open and view videos directly through Windows File Explorer on their laptop.” If a similar accident were to occur in the future, Valmet could now quickly grasp the sequence of events and restore normal production more efficiently, eliminating the need for extensive time and manual efforts to identify the cause. \"We can now use data to identify any issues in roll testing and take preventative actions with the future in mind”, says Ollila. Along with enhanced safety, this solution also enables Valmet to collect and analyze large amounts of data in near real time. This capability supports the evaluation of various test rig configurations and the comparison of test runs, helping to identify the optimal settings and parameters for more efficient operations. Ollila says that the system provides machine operators with visual dashboards on Grafana, also developed by Nortal, alongside their trending tools. “If something happens during the test run, they can contact the roll engineers. Telemetry data supports fact-based decision-making by showing detailed insights, such as pressure and flow patterns. We can see what happens and if there are any broken components in the roll, which if detected early, can mean huge cost savings. We can do full testing without building separate measuring units. All of this is made possible by the comprehensive solution Nortal has delivered.” Nortal’s Business Area Director, Petri Rönkkö, says that Valmet’s modern cloud-based solution is not that common in the heavy industry. “Consumer-facing businesses are quickly adopting cloud technologies and ways of working, but in manufacturing, factories still do a lot of manual work in a siloed local on-premises environments, each with their own tools and systems. These kinds of solutions offer a comprehensive view of what’s happening on the shop floor. Unlocking the data is great on the factory floor, but it also supports top management needs when data siloes are broken down.” – Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland Valmet’s solution is designed with scalability in mind. The same platform capabilities can be re-used in other use cases as well to save money in the future and avoid point solutions for each separate use case. A collaborative approach to success What made it possible to achieve all this in six months from start to finish? Valmet says it’s because of how the team was structured and worked together. Teemu Vento, Global Operations, Factory IT Lead, Valmet, calls this an agile way of working in cohesive collaboration. “It was an MVP, so neither party knew exactly what we’d discover. For me, the best thing was the ability to make decisions along the way .” “There were three players in the team,” says Timo Ollila. “Valmet business, Valmet IT, and Nortal. That meant we had to have an open dialogue during the development process. Together we defined and clarified our needs, made compromises and constantly discussed between the three parties to make an optimal solution. I’m a mechanical engineer, not an IT specialist. I define our needs and Nortal and Valmet IT turned those into technical solutions fit for Valmet’s factory environment. The co-operation was smooth and the active dialogue between parties was the key to success in this project.” Data-driven s cal e With more than 19,000 employees and 60 production units worldwide, Valmet is excited about the opportunities to scale this Data Collection and Visualization Solution to be used in other Valmet factories and different use cases in future. “We have plans to scale this solution and realize the benefits of the solution in wider at Valmet”, says Vento. “So far, we’ve tested many rolls with the new rig and the process continues. Over the next year, we’ll see the real benefits, as the biggest savings will come from the new way of running the rolls. With a semi-automated process, reaction times are improved, and it’s quicker to conduct tests.”, Ollila says. Ollila believes that the key to a successful project is properly describing its scope in as much detail as possible — the more work done up front, the smoother everything goes. From Nortal’s side, it might be said that if there’s one skill beyond IT that we’ve keenly developed and put into practice over our 35 years in the business, it’s the ability to listen.

    "content": "Home Insights How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Case study October 16, 2024 How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Estonia is considered one of the most advanced digitized countries in the world. Not only are the citizens more open to new technologies, but the state has also made its point to always be ahead of the curve. The government proceedings have been paperless for almost 20 years and the parliament has used AI-supported transcriptions of its proceedings for over five years. Now it was time to speed up the legislative work of the parliament with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Service Data and AI Industry Government The parliament of Estonia, the Riigikogu, is the representative body of Estonia that among other things passes legislation like acts and resolutions and ratifies and denounces foreign treaties that impose military and proprietary obligations and bring about changes in law. Acts create the rules for different fields of life in Estonia upon which the functioning of the state is based. Working on acts with the lawyers of Riigikogu’s chancellery is therefore the most important and also the most time-consuming task of the Riigikogu. So, the chancellery of the Riigikogu needed a solution that would bring more efficacy to their legal department. Mountains of data The chancellery of the Riigikogu provides the conditions necessary for the parliament to perform its constitutional functions. While the proceeding of bills is the key task of the Riigikogu, the legal and research department advises all the 101 members of the Riigikogu, the board, the committees, the parliamentary groups and the employees working for them in order that the discussion in the parliament would be knowledge-based. The department replies to the information requests of the MPs, presents its opinions and analyses draft legislation, explanatory memoranda and other procedural documents proceeded by the Riigikogu. They also reply to information queries from the public. Thus far all the inquiries were addressed manually and one by one by the lawyers. With the vast amount of data generated and stored by the Riigikogu, traditional methods of document retrieval are time-consuming, laborious and prone to errors, and don’t provide a good user experience for fact checking. The solution needed to address these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) into a robust, user-friendly chatbot interface, streamlining access to information and enhancing decision-making processes. Intelligent search with legislative credibility We created a Nortal Tark based intelligent search solution MVP for the Chancellery of the Riigikogu that works in their internal web within the MS Azure infrastructure. Nortal Tark works through all the documents that lawyers used to search for answers manually before, e.g., the bill information system with all the legislative documents, including the European Union ones, previous official inquiries and answers, chancellery’s public documents etc. Tark translates the incoming question for the database inquiry, finds the answer, and presents it to the respective lawyer with references to the original documents. The lawyer can then use the presented information to, for example, formulate an answer to an inquiry or compile topic sheets for the MPs. Almost all the data involved with acts is public in Estonia and this first version of Riigikogu’s Nortal Tark implementation uses only public data . A country’s legislative body produces a lot of documents, even when the country is as forward-thinking and thin in bureaucracy as Estonia. So, the data that needed to be worked through for the implementation was colossal. The intelligent search application also takes into consideration the legislative credibility dimension. The aim is to pinpoint the most reliable source for inquiries, because what answers to the text search criteria, might not be the right answer from the lawyers’ perspective. For example, a simple search might come up with a document containing a similar question in it, but the lawyer needs an answer from a legislative document. Karl-Morten Koppel, Head of IT systems of the Parliament of Estonia \"This project has provided us with valuable insights into current AI models and their capabilities. It marks an important step in identifying how and where AI can be most effectively applied to maximize benefits, with the goal of improving both efficiency and the quality of services in the future, allowing citizens, MPs, and parliamentary staff to save time and work more productively.\" The main benefits of the intelligent search for Riigikogu Better user experience New, innovative solution Cost-effectiveness from timesaving Fast support One of the primary advantages of this intelligent search system is its ability to retrieve documents quickly and accurately, which makes answering inquiries faster. Users can interact with the chatbot using natural language queries, reducing the need for extensive manual searches or specific expertise. This significantly reduces the time spent digging up documents, allowing the chancellery staff to focus more on important matters. The intelligent search function for the chancellery of the Riigikogu is just the first step to test the waters of how the Riigikogu can benefit from genAI in the substantial work that they do. The next possible steps include making the application available to more people within the Riigikogu, moving it on-premises and adding internal data with corresponding access management to the system. The version with the public data could then be expanded to public use for the queries they might have for the Riigikogu.

    "content": "Home Insights Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Case study September 2, 2024 Modern integration strategy supporting Outokumpu’s energy efficiency management Nortal introduces an API-based solution to enable more efficient energy management to support Outokumpu’s ambitious sustainability goals. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Outokumpu is the global leader in sustainable stainless steel. Stainless steel operations are energy intensive, so Outokumpu uses the best available technology, electric arc furnaces, and continuously strives to make its production operations more energy efficient. In fact, Outokumpu’s biggest plant, located in Tornio, Finland, is the biggest single energy user in the Nordics. In general, to produce a ton of stainless steel in an electric arc furnace requires about 440 kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough to power hundreds of homes for an entire month. This is to say that when a company like Outokumpu turns its attention to saving energy, it is more than just a gesture—it is of global significance. By the end of 2024, the company’s goal is to improve energy efficiency by eight percent compared to a similar period two years prior. This will equate to an energy saving of around 600,000 megawatt hours, enough to power 15,000 households. Part of what makes this possible is Nortal helping Outokumpu feed the right data to their energy management system (EMS). Harnessing the power of data The problem is that data systems are many and diverse, with various downstream locations for data needed in the EMS. Data from manufacturing execution systems and other factory floor systems, such as maintenance breaks and production planning are needed for efficient energy management. Nortal created an API that combines the data sources and channels in to the EMS in close to real-time. Harnessing multiple sources of data, creating a harmonized API layer, and doing it fast, means that the savings can be staggering for a company that purchases energy on the spot market. “Outokumpu’s sustainability strategy aims at decarbonization and supporting customers to reduce their supply chain emissions,” says Harri Salo , Outokumpu’s Manager – Energy, Electrical and Crane Services. “Integration of the energy management system greatly supports this strategy. It enables us to measure electricity consumption, providing data that enables the possibility to adjust and optimize electricity usage. Additionally, this capability improves the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts and allows us to enhance our cost efficiency in production.” Beyond cost savings Energy and cost savings are of course important, but Outokumpu has even bigger aspirations. “Yes, EMS is a major scalable solution, which will save energy,” says Junhui Wang , Outokumpu’s Head of Data Platforms & Integrations. “But it’s much more than that. The EMS leverages our API strategy. It’s one of the enablers of our sustainability strategy, the cornerstone in our API strategy and governance.” What this means is that the solution is scalable and can be taken beyond the Tornio plant. It also supports the production of Outokumpu’s spearhead climate solution, Outokumpu Circle Green®, a product line with up to 93 percent lower carbon footprint compared to the global industry average*. Outokumpu calculates that if all stainless steel was produced in the same way, then global carbon emissions from the entire stainless steel value chain could be reduced by 364 million tons per year, or roughly 900 million one-way flights of a passenger from London to New York. “Outokumpu’s aim is to remain as the global leader in sustainable stainless steel,” says Harri Salo. “And we’re committed to keep the global warming at 1.5 ºC according to the Science-Based Targets Initiative”. *) Global average CO₂ emissions (2023): 7 kg CO₂e per kg of stainless steel (Outokumpu’s calculation based on data provided by CRU, worldstainless and Kobolde & Partners AB). Outokumpu Circle Green CO₂ emissions: down to 0.5 kilos of CO₂e per kg of stainless steel. Strategic partnership Helping to pave the way for advances in the steel industry digitalization is Nortal, who has worked in the metals sector for almost 40 years, much of that time with Outokumpu. “EMS is an excellent example of a solution that drives our customer’s high-level enterprise architecture and integration strategy forward while introducing clear business benefits”, says Jarkko Enden , CTO of Nortal Finland. “Long strategic partnerships, such as the one we have with Outokumpu, are a unique trait of Nortal Finland that we’re especially proud of.” – Junhui Wang, Head of Data Platforms & Integrations, Outokumpu Nortal has been a pivotal partner for Outokumpu, providing significant support in implementing our integration and API strategy over the past years. Our integration landscape, characterized by a diverse array of technologies and tools, has been complex. With Nortal's expertise, we are now on the right path towards achieving our North Star Integration Architecture.

    "content": "Home Insights Battling pandemics with the help of AI Case study October 9, 2024 Battling pandemics with the help of AI In a national health crisis, the population’s need for fast, professional, and trustworthy advice skyrockets. Even with seasonal illnesses, the increase in inquiries is sudden, burdening the phone lines of health offices. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) needed a futureproof solution to make communication with the citizens more efficient. Enter Artificial Intelligence. Service Data and AI Industry Healthcare Lower Saxony has a population of eight million, making it the fourth largest state in population among Germany’s 16 states. The Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) is the state’s central authority for communicable and non-communicable diseases and health risks. The NGLA aims to promote and protect the health of the people of Lower Saxony. 1 week, 1000 phone calls When COVID-19 hit Germany, the Lower Saxony state health office’s phone lines were overflooded with people hungry for information about this fast-spreading new disease. The health office received well over 1000 telephone inquiries a week. The delegation of calls via a switchboard could not be handled due to the overload, both in terms of personnel and infrastructure. However, the majority of the calls had identical questions that could have been answered using standardized templates. Given that the last four pandemics occurred almost every 15 years on average, and some believe that pandemics have been happening more often in recent decades, the NLGA needed a solution that would be futureproof not overcrowding their phone lines again, but still giving people the information and peace of mind that they needed. Efficacy through the secure use of AI We developed an AI-based chat and voice bot for the Lower Saxony state health office (NLGA) built on our AI solution Nortal Tark . With the help of the intelligent assistant named Nova , citizens can ask NLGA questions around the clock while relieving the health department’s employees of some of the work burden. Users can call up the chatbot on the NLGA website , ask their questions, and receive an answer within seconds, for example, on specific diseases such as COVID-19 or measles or even recommendations on what to do in the case of head lice. This turnkey solution has the secure use of AI at its core – on a secure database that the NLGA controls 100 percent. Nova collects information from several knowledge sources, which the NLGA previously views, checks, and selects. The database is, therefore, professionally curated, can be constantly expanded by NLGA, and protected against data misuse. The intelligent assistant quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content, making communication with the citizens futureproof. It answers standard questions in various languages ​​and in the NLGA’s tone. Dr. Fabian Feil, President of the NLGA \"We are proud to be the first authority in Lower Saxony to launch an AI-supported chatbot, thus significantly improving communication with citizens even in the event of a crisis. A big thank you goes to our colleagues at Nortal, who were able to accurately identify our needs and, together with our team, in a very short time created a more than competitive solution using new technology.\" 24-hour service with minimal burden The project makes the NLGA a digital pioneer in the public sector. It exemplifies how generative AI and large language models (LLMs) can be used in administrative authorities. Employees’ time answering simple inquiries is reduced, which is particularly helpful in crises during epidemics or seasonal illnesses. The more efficient processing of queries leaves them more time to focus on more complex tasks and inquiries. The benefits of implementing Nova Good user experience Users can easily access the chatbot on the NLGA website, benefitting from a 24-hour chat service without language barriers. Futureproof With the help of generative AI and LLMs, the chatbot quickly acquires new information and understands the context of the content.

    "title": "AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel",
    "content": "Home Insights AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Case study June 25, 2024 AI in Action: Surface Defect Detection in Outokumpu Stainless Steel Artificial intelligence is much talked about, but solutions running in production are rare. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest stainless steel producer, turned to Nortal, its trusted partner for decades, to create a business-critical AI solution that is set to be scaled globally. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources While steel has been manufactured for a thousand years, stainless steel wasn’t created until the early 1900s. And given its complex chemical post-processing procedure, engineers and scientists have never stopped trying to perfect it. Challenge Surface defects cannot be avoided even in the most sophisticated production facilities. However, by detecting these defects early in the process, it is possible to better ensure that the customer gets the right quality required for their needs. Whenever a stainless steel surface is on display, such as on a building’s façade, it must be flawless. A car part hidden from view, however, can tolerate some defects. The key is to make sure the quality produced matches the end user’s needs, ensuring both a happy customer and a profitable business. There is a significant business advantage for manufacturers able to identify surface issues as far upstream as possible, allowing preventive action, reduced cost of reprocessing, and right-quality products routed to customers. Outokumpu, Europe’s largest producer of stainless steel, turned to Nortal to develop an advanced surface inspection system (ASIS) that could be scaled globally to other Outokumpu sites. Nortal is Outokumpu’s partner for its Global Data Platform, enabling seamless collaboration in the scaling processes. Solution Understanding defects and root causes like never before “A defect in hot rolling can extend further down to cold rolling, and a scratch can elongate to several meters,” explains Maximilian Hartmann , ASIS project manager from Outokumpu. “Understanding how defects occur helps us improve processes and take action early enough so we’re not doing unnecessary rework.” Beginning in October 2024, Outokumpu’s Tornio plant will switch to an altogether new version of an ASIS system which uses AI and Machine Learning to identify defects. “Human inspectors can’t evaluate a coil to the same degree of detail and consistency that a machine learning system can,” says Hartmann. “The renewed ASIS system supports inspectors in evaluating the full coil beyond what bare human eye can detect.” Constructing the new version of ASIS system was especially complicated, since building from scratch was not an option. First, a proof-of-concept ASIS system built by a previous vendor needed to be stabilized. The team utilized as much of the existing solution as possible but were required to re-engineer the application’s hybrid cloud architecture from scratch in order to meet the high availability requirements for the application. As a production-critical solution, ASIS must run even in scenarios when the internet is down, adding to the complexity of the required technology architecture. Nortal’s Senior Data Scientist, Erkki Alamäe, greatly enhanced the AI-based defect detection model, enabling the team to integrate it more tightly into the solution and significantly raise the level of automation in the defect detection process. Result Nortal’s solution unlocks massive benefits “Surface quality is one of the most important parameters of stainless steel production. The new version of the ASIS is a system we can scale globally and use the Machine Learning model to help the operators’ work in production without relying solely on manual labor to ensure right quality for every customer,” says Hartmann. The benefits are many. Customers get the quality they require, production planning and flow are optimized, and coils with problems are repaired or rerouted. Defects identified earlier mean lower costs, plus long-term benefits thanks to the identification of root causes. It’s a multisite solution that will allow quality information for coils to be transferred between various Outokumpu sites in Europe. Additionally, there are significant savings in storage costs, rejected materials, and through fewer customer claims. – Maximilian Hartmann, ASIS Project Manager Outokumpu I’m really happy how the development has gone with Nortal. We always moved constructively in the right direction. The way of working is clean, well-organized, and people talk openly. As the new version of ASIS is taken into use, the full value of ASIS materializes. The value of ASIS will become even more evident as we continue our rollout across additional lines and sites, confirming our belief in its potential.

    "content": "Home Insights Data architecture unlocking new business opportunities for one of Finland’s largest food services company Case study April 3, 2024 Data architecture unlocking new business opportunities for one of Finland’s largest food services company Compass Group Finland partnered with Nortal to build a data platform enabling growth and increased operational efficiency. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Consumer Enterprise Compass Group Finland is one of Finland’s most prominent food service companies, serving clients with €230 million in annual revenue. Their primary business is providing B2B food and multi-services to all sectors in Finland and serve thousands of Finns from kids in nurseries to students in lower and higher education and from working people in lunch restaurants to seniors across the country. They partnered with Nortal to build data architecture that would allow them to gather mission-critical business insights and make data-driven decisions to further drive growth and operational efficiency. The result was a data platform that saved on costs and enabled faster innovation, allowing Compass Group to focus on tackling its mission – critical challenges while increasing competitive advantage in a perpetually growing market. Challenge A fragmented data landscape slows down the speed of innovation, creating bottlenecks that slow development. In late 2019, Compass Group reached out to Nortal to build an integration from their previous reporting system to their new CRM. The goal was to successfully transfer data and eventually eliminate the old reporting system entirely. After this project’s successful completion, Compass Group wanted to figure out how they could use this data to better solve their most mission-critical business challenges. The challenge was a scattered data landscape with no centralized system or workflows that would allow for easy data retrieval. As with most other large service companies, Compass Group has hundreds of stakeholders and organizations within its orbit. All of them have their own data in fragmented places. There is no way to centralize this information to get a cohesive understanding of what’s going on and , therefore , make the right business decisions – fast. This slows the speed of innovation and creates unnecessary bottlenecks hindering development. Solution A centralized data platform hosting Compass Group Finland’s data and intelligence. As a solution, we built a data platform that functioned as the central ecosystem of Compass Group Finland’s data and intelligence. It hosted all domains – from customer to financial, HR, sales, and procurement data – while allowing incoming data flow from various source systems. The platform enables all modeling and publishing to happen directly within this same system, with system-specific data being turned into easily understood concepts. The data platform and all related services were built on Azure. Moving it away from physical data centers to a cloud environment simplified the architecture significantly and helped save on costs. – Pekka Hytönen, Senior Manager, D&T Transformation and IT Operations, Compass Group Finland Oy Ongoing support from Nortal has been excellent, and we have been able to add new data sources and integrations to our solution easily. Impact Quick data-driven decision – making allows for faster innovation and positive environmental impacts. The impact of this data architecture project has been felt across many areas of the business. The elimination of Compass Group’s old reporting system and the transfer of data from centers into the cloud slashed costs significantly. With the centralized data platform, Compass Group can now retrieve information to make data-driven business decisions in record time. Rather than spending months piecing together different data sets to get an answer to a question, Compass Group can now turn to the platform for near-immediate results. Compass Group can allocate resources, manage waste, and fine-tune food orders much more efficiently w ith precise, up-to-date data. Customers also benefit from the additional insight, with the company being able to list ingredient and sourcing details on menus. This newfound visibility also has an environmental impact. With more visibility into supply chains, the company has a better understanding of where raw materials come. This enables them to make strategic interventions and more eco-conscious choices where possible. A solid technical foundation enables the leadership team to tackle business needs quickly and with agility – ensuring they can stay ahead of the competition with a high rate of innovation. – Pekka Hytönen, Senior Manager, D&T Transformation and IT Operations, Compass Group Finland Oy Looking backward, a couple of years after the solution was deployed, we can say that it has proven to be robust, reliable, scalable, and flexible to adjust to our needs.

    "content": "Case study March 14, 2023 by Newel Rice, Sr. Solutions Architect Nortal creates high-volume event streaming for large telecommunications and wireless company Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise Telecommunication and Media With Nortal’s help, one of the largest telecommunications and wireless companies in the world accomplished near real-time solutions utilizing Snowflake’s Data Cloud. In doing so, Nortal made our client’s struggling architecture come to life and empowered other business users with the proper data they needed when they needed it the most. Getting to data faster has never been more in demand within the telecommunication space. With the pace of their industry set on eleven, our client needed to find a way to get out from under a failing architecture for high-volume event streaming application data. The Digital side of the company has made great strides in creating detailed event streaming data from the applications they are building. However, the ability to receive, process, and make that data available to the business has proven to be a significant challenge for this Fortune 500 company. Lost and slow moving data combined with the soaring costs were sending the business into a tailspin and they needed to find a way out of this problem and fast. Challenge The legacy architecture our client was struggling with is an amalgamation of in-house solutions that uses a batch processing pipeline built on top of AWS services, including: Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) Simple Storage Service (S3) Apache Spark on Amazon EMR clusters After numerous failures of this architecture at key points in their business, the large telecom company knew they were in trouble and turned to Nortal to assist with the challenges they were facing. Nortal’s long-time partnership and proven experience in this domain was the obvious choice in helping achieve the following goals: Demonstrating the future state solution will be able to handle a sustained maximum historical peak load the company has seen so far in production Benchmark the results proving future state architecture and giving a reference to where they started with the new architecture Reduced complexity in the architecture Reduce the labor-intensive aspects and requirements of the current state architecture Optimize costs of operating the event streaming near real-time data pipelines Minimally disrupt the in-place services, taking advantage of the streaming event driven/event bus architecture Get data in the hands of the business users faster (ideally within an hour of an event being received) With their sights on these goals, Nortal, our partner Snowflake, and in collaboration with an in-house technical team, set about to create the new architecture in a matter of weeks to address these goals. Nortal’s approach With Nortal’s deep knowledge in Snowflake’s Data Cloud technologies, the team decided to take advantage of the existing investment that the customer has previously made into these technologies. Our main goal was to apply the Snowflake Connector for Kafka to the project to increase results from the previous architecture. Capitalizing on the pre-existing managed platform, we were able to enhance the platform for containerized workloads and services. Results The solution proved that it is more than capable of handling a sustained peak workload. In fact, the solution can handle 2x peak workload and with a delayed start of the solution with a demonstrated ability to overcome the message backlog By creating a benchmarking harness and documenting results, our client can turn to these tools and information when making changes to the solution. The complexity of the solution has been vastly reduced in using commercially available and supported tooling. Tooling that comes with its own documentation and support reducing the burned on internal technical team The solution is configurable not only for connectivity but also for scalability with automation that has been built to virtually eliminate most of the labor-intensive aspects and requirements of the legacy architecture The cost of the near real-time solution operating at full scale is less than the incumbent batch solution and furthermore, is scalable to meet the needs of the demand permitting even more economy in operation The solution in no way impedes the legacy solution. The new solution operates alongside the legacy solution taking advantage of the MSK architecture permitting a full cutover to the new architecture and decommissioning of the legacy solution at the convenience of our client The new architecture has shown to deliver event streaming data ready and consumable by the business users within as little as 7 seconds and at most in about 60 seconds The new architecture is flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of other and similar workloads The new architecture integrates with our client’s security and brings data to a platform that has broad reaching capabilities and a rich set of business data giving the business user the ability to combine this data in new ways to tease out new insights and opportunities The body of work was accomplished ahead of schedule in a short 5 week timeframe Impact The demands for the business to have access to data within near real-time is becoming, if not already being, the standard expectation of the telecom industry. This need is relentless and unyielding for companies like our client to stay competitive now and in the future. We are proud to have transformed a cripplingly slow and costly batch based process that was failing to meet the company’s needs, to a fast, nimble, scalable and cost-effective architecture. It was abundantly clear to this tech giant that they needed help of Nortal to create an architecture that wasn’t a back-breaking venture fraught with inadequacies and delays, but rather a transparent, flexible, and capable business tool that gets them the data when they need it most. In this new solution, our client now has the capability and the confidence to move forward translating insights into opportunities at near real-time speed for less cost than their legacy batch-based architecture could ever provide.

    "content": "Home Insights Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Case study October 29, 2022 Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Service Data and AI Industry Government Being unemployed is not only difficult for a citizen but also costly for the government, especially if it lasts more than six months. The longer a person is without a job, the harder it is for them to find the next one. And for the state, it negatively affects GDP – more money is spent on unemployment benefits and workforce retraining, and more time is spent on counseling. In 2020, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund decided that AI adoption in the public sector would help to tackle long-term unemployment and help people get back to work faster. Challenge Missing the bigger picture The trouble with the current process of understanding and counseling clients with job loss is the considerable number of resources required to work through extensive background information of all the customers and get a complete overview of the caseloads. Profiling data per one unemployed person comprises 45 separate indicators, from socio-demographics, prior employment history, labor market characteristics, and up-to-date health data and job vacancies. The abundance of data makes it laborious and error-prone to distinguish the unemployed who have more difficulties getting back into the labor market and should receive more attention and resources. In addition, the state is missing an overview of whether the implemented measures and current labor market policies are relevant and cost-effective. Solution Reducing the harmful effects of unemployment To keep unemployment time as short as possible, raise the quality of the services provided to the unemployed, and increase the efficiency of organizational processes, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) partnered with Nortal. In collaboration with the Center for IT Impact Studies (CITIS) and Resta, Nortal developed an AI-powered decision-support tool (OTT) that predicts the risk of long-term unemployment. The OTT tool helps EUIF counselors better understand their customers’ situations by calculating the probability of getting a new job and the level of risk of becoming unemployed again. Moreover, OTT provides counselors with information which factors impact the risk score most and unveil the possible reasons for unemployment. The decision-support tool collects data from many public registries connected via X-Road and analyses information over the last five years, including salaries from the Tax Office, education from the Board of Education, and subsidies from the Social Welfare Office. As a result, with the help of OTT, counselors can distinguish low-risk applicants from high-risk ones. The first group is most likely able to find the next job independently, but the second needs detailed assistance. OTT allows counselors to focus on jobseekers with the highest risk of prolonged unemployment. In addition, the tool provides EUIF with a more profound understanding of the labor market’s condition and helps to develop data-based labor. 3,8% of Estonia’s yearly expenditures were saved by reducing unemployment by a single day 95% forecast accuracy 100% visibility of the unemployed, risks, and regional trends daily Impact Planning labor policies with real-time data With the help of Machine Learning, the Estonian government has a management tool for implementing and planning policy measures with a real-time prediction of long-term unemployment risks and automated suggestions of the best ways to prevent them. — The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) The solution is an AI-powered decision support tool, which supplements the official data from multiple government registries and the extensive experience of the counselors in helping people get back into the labor market. Result Helping people get back to work faster In 2021, the AI-powered decision support tool OTT was awarded The Best Data-Based Digital Service in the Estonian public sector. EUIF counselors are utilizing this solution daily, with positive results. The decision-support tool shows the counselors where to put their effort and priorities, helping them make better decisions when allocating resources to those who need them the most. Further, the practical experience of using AI has opened new possibilities for how the calculations resulting from automated impact assessment solutions can be applied – for example, providing evidence-based information on how benefits and subsidies affect the movement to work and if the current measures are relevant and cost-effective. As a positive side-effect of these types of solutions, the state will have a real-time overview of the current unemployment status on an individual, regional, and state-wide level, helping understand the labor market’s ongoing processes better and take a proactive role in developing effective labor policies.

    "content": "Home Insights Transforming data into operational business success Article December 18, 2024 Transforming data into operational business success Three real-life case examples reveal how data-driven decisions and innovativeness can be realized in the complex operational environment of any industry. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources As an operational leader, you’re no stranger to the complications of data management. When the supply chain is scattered, and particularly if your business is a puzzle of merged organizations and acquired entities, your operational teams must wrestle with countless data sources, formats, and systems, from ERP and CRM to accounting, inventory, and project management. Each system operates with its unique data model, structure, and quality. This makes it tedious to create a unified view over your operations – let alone across the organization or the entire supply chain. In this article, we will share some best practices and real-life examples of Nortal’s customers who are leaders in their industries. Despite their different business environments, all these customers have realized that moving from an experience-based to a data-driven approach will enable a step change in the efficiency and innovativeness of daily operations. The value of data platforms in running the daily operations Data integration combines data from different sources and systems into a unified and consistent format to easily access, analyze, and share. Data integration and a functioning data platform can help your daily operations achieve four key benefits: Know what’s going on: By eliminating data silos, duplicates, and inconsistencies, you know what is happening and what comes next in the field and operations across the value chain. Share relevant data: By creating a single source of truth of your data, you can enable your teams and external stakeholders, such as partners or regulators, to access and use the operational data they need. Reduce costs: With a data layer that can be flexibly modified, there is less pressure to change the often rigid and old operational systems, thereby saving costs. Increase innovation: By connecting and enriching your data, you can uncover new patterns, trends, and opportunities in your operations, leading to unforeseen business innovations and faster development of new offerings. Utilizing advanced technologies like Artificial intelligence also only becomes possible when your data is consistent and unified. Compass Group took charge of operational restaurant data Compass Group is the world’s leading food and multi-service company, bringing joy and refreshment to the days of schoolchildren, workers, seniors, and event-goers through its hundreds of restaurants. Compass Group Finland’s data-driven journey began from a scattered data landscape, where data generated through countless acquisitions and spread across different repositories made it challenging to get to the quick, facts-based decisions needed in today’s fast-paced market. The demand for operational data was multi-faceted: finance produced masses of information, but it did not speak the language of the businesses. The tool for planning the daily menus in the restaurants offered no transparency on whether the plans were followed, which caused inefficiencies in production forecasting and supply chains. The sustainability function, in turn, needed data to respond to regulatory needs and to support the green transformation. Together with the customer, Nortal has identified more than ten business functions where the need for better use of data is imminent. With Compass Group, the work started by modeling the data and naming entities according to the language used in the business and operations. We then created a centralized data platform that brought all of Compass Group’s data under one roof. Every piece of data on this platform, from customer information to financials and HR, was neatly organized and easily accessible. By moving to a cloud environment, we not only simplified the architecture but also helped Compass Group cut down on costs. The new data platform allows Compass Group to make swift, informed decisions on all levels, from operations to top management. Resource allocation, waste management, and materials ordering have become more efficient, positively impacting the company’s bottom line and environmental burden. Customers also enjoy a more transparent dining experience, with detailed ingredients and sourcing information at their fingertips. Data has also found entirely new and unforeseen use cases. The data modeling done in the restaurants’ menu planning yielded unexpected benefits when Compass Group’s suppliers started requesting product demand forecasts. The readily gathered and modeled data made it easy to build and share the needed estimates with the suppliers in real-time. Energy group St1 drives business sustainability and scalability with effective data handling Nortal’s collaboration with St1 , an energy group committed to renewable fuels, has produced a data platform solution that ensures compliance with the EU’s stringent sustainability criteria for biomass used in energy production. We have also developed digital solutions to manage and enable transparency across St1’s value chain. The solutions provide visibility into the inventory of biofuel raw materials, allowing the optimization of sourcing, processing, and distribution. These capabilities, for their part, ensure the scalability of St1’s business operations. One of St1’s latest investments, the Gothenburg biorefinery, is an example of the value of the newly built solutions. In Gothenburg, various raw materials will be utilized to produce renewable diesel, jet fuel, and bionaphtha. The novel tools help effectively oversee the refinery’s entire value chain of renewable fuels, sustainability criteria, and the plant’s physical mass balance. Outokumpu transforms into a data-driven enterprise for agility and innovation Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, started moving forward with digital manufacturing in 2019. The aim was to fully digitalize its largest factory in Tornio, Finland, transforming it into the industry’s most digital and cost-efficient stainless-steel operation. As other Outokumpu sites were to follow Tornio’s example, the company needed a comprehensive, modern, industrial digital platform to support its ambition . An enterprise-grade technology platform transforms an organization into a data-driven powerhouse, equipping it to excel in a rapidly changing business environment by enhancing strategic decision-making and operational efficiency and fostering continuous innovation. Traditionally, separating business intelligence (BI) and analytics from applications, APIs, and integrations has led to fragmented data models, communication issues, and silos that hinder organizational cohesion. A composable enterprise approach aligned with data product principles and team structures breaks down these silos, enabling unified data flow and cohesive insights. Outokumpu, for instance, exemplifies this with its platform engineering strategy, leveraging hybrid-cloud data, integration, and API platforms managed by collaborative teams, including Nortal’s development teams. This approach not only ensures seamless integration and better data accessibility but also drives continuous improvement, unlocking value for the core business. Data-driven operations start today Forward-thinking companies like Compass Group, Outokumpu, and St1 have demonstrated the immense benefits of adopting a data-driven approach. For operational businesses across industries, where data capabilities are often inherited from several mergers and acquisitions and supply chains are scarce, a data platform frequently proves to bear unforeseeable value. Becoming data-driven can provide a quick fix to that thorn in your side that slows your daily operations, provide the long-needed transparency to the supply chain, or enable entirely new, unpredictable innovations that would not have occurred to anybody without the latest insights. Ultimately, something starting from a small trial can be transformative for your business. Going forward, the ability to effectively harness and utilize data will be a defining factor in the efficiency and innovativeness of daily operations, and industry leaders are already embracing this change.

Tailored solutions for your unique needs More efficient space utilization - achieving savings on fixed costs by increasing utilization rates and consolidating An organization needs premises in order to provide physical service delivery. With current practices, the utilization rates of office spaces often remain significantly low which creates costs in terms of excess space capacity and insufficient service production. Space resource management helps in reserving the right space for service delivery and the smooth functioning of a professional's work, as well as in organizing space reservations into a cohesive whole. Our solution integrates appointment data, optimizes room allocations based on factors like doctor movement, and seamlessly syncs results with Outlook calendars, using HL7 FHIR standard interfaces. The solution can be integrated with patient information systems, facility services, and other background systems. Personnel resource allocation planning – the cornerstone of efficient service delivery In industries where service delivery requires professionals with a variety of different skills and qualifications, an unnecessary amount of time and effort is spent on planning. Processes can be fragmented, and manual, and rely on the specialized knowledge and expertise of individual people. We have co-developed with our customers a solution utilizing MS Power Platform and Azure platforms. The benefits of the solution lie in centralized data management, where everyone can see the information according to their user role needs. Shared information flows through the system from one stage of the process to the next, reducing manual work and errors combined with the usage of historical data used as a basis for plans and for developing operations. Process automation in an industrial environment A manufacturing client suffered from a very manual, and therefore slow and error-prone, purchase order processing system which required manual conversion and data en try to an ERP system. To speed up and automate the process we did a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Proof of Concept (PoC) project to evaluate the compatibility of Microsoft Power Automate with Oracle EBS and assess the feasibility and benefits of automating our customer’s order creation process. Product m arketing data m anagement solution One of our manufacturing customers had an outdated system that was burdensome to manage, with manual steps and slow adaptation to changes. We assisted in scoping, defining, and planning the replacement of this original solution, which was built on Mendix, with the goal of improving usability and reducing costs. We developed a Product Marketing Data Management solution to enrich and maintain product marketing data, including texts and typical product properties displayed on their website in an online material selection tool for end customers. The latest version, released in March 2024, was built on the Power Platform using Canvas App and Dataverse. A future-focused sales and customer service concept and tools for building deeper customer relationships Significant challenges can arise from a fragmented tool landscape and scattered customer-related data, leading to limited visibility into customer interactions. This disconnection complicates the management of these interactions and hinders the generation of accurate sales forecasts. Without a centralized system, leveraging customer insights becomes difficult, impeding effective customer management and strategic decision-making. Using Microsoft Power Platform, Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, we designed and implemented a modern, cloud-based CRM solution tailored to our customer's needs. This solution enabled a centralized view of all customer interactions, streamlined the sales and service processes, and provided a solid foundation for advanced customer management and sales forecasting capabilities.

Embracing them is a necessary part of growth and success. However, there are ways to avoid pitfalls that come with GenAI. Jump to the 7-step guide Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise GenAI tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and their derivative systems, such as virtual assistants or chatbots, are increasingly being adopted by organizations across both private and public sectors. These systems can solve many mundane routine tasks, streamline operations, and enhance productivity. The technology behind LLMs has become widely available through open-source software, making it accessible to a broader audience. Resources such as the Hugging Face repository facilitate the sharing and deployment of LLMs, enabling users to integrate these advanced systems into their workflows promptly. The availability of open-source LLMs, coupled with their competitive quality compared to proprietary models, makes them an attractive option for various applications. According to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report , 149 LLMs were released in 2023 alone, and 98 are open source. In addition to large open-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, smaller models can be conveniently run locally on a laptop or on-premises to fulfill smaller specialized tasks. However, this being a relatively new and maverick technology pushing our comfort levels in both ways, novel risks also come with it , from model theft to bias. To provide guidelines for identifying and evaluating these risks, there are numerous risk assessment frameworks and published analyses, such as the OWASP , NIST AI risk management framework and the European Commission’s AI Act . Article 10 things to watch out for with open source gen AI A multi-faceted approach to risk management The risks fall roughly into three categories – infrastructure, user, and model-related. While addressing the infrastructure risks following software development best practices and risks related to users can be managed by educating employees, the threats related to models themselves (and how users communicate with them) are more challenging to catch and mitigate. These risks pertain to the LLMs themselves, including issues related to their reliability and ethical use. Open-source models may lack the rigorous testing and validation processes that proprietary models undergo, potentially increasing the likelihood of errors or biases in their outputs. They can also risk providing low-quality or factually incorrect answers, disclosing sensitive information, and possessing an excessive agency, i.e., too much autonomy in communicating with other parts of the larger system without human oversight. One of the best ways to manage the risks associated with the models is to implement AI guardrails . AI guardrails are predefined rules, filters, and mechanisms around the model guiding the AI’s behavior, ensuring they operate within legal boundaries in an expected, acceptable, and safe way. They help to prevent unintended consequences, such as biased, erroneous, or toxic outputs, privacy violations, and security breaches. For open-source LLMs, AI guardrails can be implemented at various stages of the model lifecycle, from data collection and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. However, most enterprises use “off the shelf” models rather than training models themselves, making it challenging to control the quality and nature of the training data. Nevertheless, they can test the model with various inputs and evaluate outputs. Jump to the 7-step guide 7 steps to a more responsible GenAI Identifying the risks is only the first step. Here’s how to effectively address AI-related risks to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs. 1. Maintain infrastructure hygiene Risks like DoS attacks and unauthorized access to the model (i.e., model theft) come from the underlying infrastructure where LLMs are deployed. As cloud-based services dominate LLM-based systems implementation, cloud service providers such as Microsoft Azure, GCP, and AWS typically implement robust security measures to protect the underlying infrastructure themselves. This includes regular software updates, patch management, and network security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. They also deploy strategies to safeguard against DoS attacks, which can disrupt the availability of LLMs. This can involve firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic monitoring to identify and block malicious activities. While securing the infrastructure may seem primarily out of your hands, organizations using LLMs must still actively secure their deployments by managing access, configuring networks, and protecting sensitive data through encryption and monitoring. 2. Invest in AI-literacy The aphorism “human error” wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t a reality. There certainly are risks associated with how users interact with LLMs. For instance, users might attempt to alter model instructions via prompt jailbreaking or submit insulting content such as “you are the worst AI ever,” trying to engage the model in unwanted behavior. Overreliance on the model-generated answers without critical assessment and further propagating this potentially biased or harmful content is another example of user-associated risk. AI literacy is essential to mitigate user-associated risks by helping users understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as their inability to comprehend context like humans or their tendency to produce biased or inaccurate outputs. Educating users to evaluate responses critically and use AI to complement human expertise reduces overreliance and the spread of misinformation. Clear guidelines and policies for respectful and ethical usage, including avoiding unauthorized GenAI tools for business purposes and harmful interactions, further ensure responsible engagement. Organizations can also provide resources and training to promote informed and effective use of AI systems. 3. Moderate prompt inputs Moderating user prompt inputs is a crucial step in AI guardrails, ensuring the secure and effective operation of LLMs, as it addresses risks such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and engagement in harmful or undesirable behaviors. By implementing robust input scanning and moderation, organizations can safeguard against manipulation attempts, protect user privacy, and ensure the model produces accurate and appropriate outputs. The following measures can help achieve these goals: Remove hidden text containing non-printable, invisible Unicode characters from text inputs that can contain hidden instructions to manipulate model behaviors. Clearly divide model instructions and user input in the system prompt to avoid prompt jailbreaks. Provide user input separated by some identifier, e.g., triple quotes. Filter out toxic inputs attempting to engage the model in harmful behavior. Detect and exclude personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent identity leaks or misuse up to identity theft. Restrict prohibited input types, such as code snippets or hyperlinks. Avoid undesired topics like religion, violence, or harassment using tools like OpenAI’s Moderator API. Clean user inputs. Remove any special characters or sequences that could interfere with the prompt. 4. Limit access and excessive agency Excessive agency in LLMs refers to the risk of AI systems taking action or influencing decisions beyond their intended scope, potentially causing security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, or unintended outcomes. One critical aspect of addressing the risk of excessive agency in AI models is to limit their access and capabilities. LLMs may perform unintended and unexpected actions when connected or integrated to other systems. By restricting the model’s access to sensitive information and keeping it separate from critical systems, organizations can prevent the AI from acting with too much autonomy. This involves carefully defining the scope of the AI’s tasks and ensuring it does not operate beyond its intended purpose. Regular vulnerability testing helps identify and address system weaknesses, mitigating the risk of excessive agency. 5. Track and monitor interactions Effectively tracking and monitoring interactions between users and AI models is vital for ensuring the security and reliability of AI systems. By maintaining detailed logs of all inputs and outputs, for example, using tools like Langfuse , organizations can identify and address potential issues such as prompt injections, data leaks, or other unintended behaviors. Logging provides a comprehensive record that can be analyzed to detect anomalies or patterns that may indicate misuse, enabling swift corrective action. Organizations can prevent harmful or unintended instructions from influencing the AI’s outputs by ensuring that inputs are sanitized. Monitoring interactions also helps identify areas where the AI model may not perform as expected, providing insights into potential biases or inaccuracies in its responses. 6. Label AI-generated output Clearly labeling AI-generated content (i.e., created with AI) helps remind users to critically assess AI outputs, reducing overreliance and reinforcing responsible use. These measures safeguard against potential threats, such as users causing harm or damage by following received faulty information in areas with low expertise, ensuring that AI models remain tools under human oversight rather than independent agents. 7. Evaluate model output When crafting output guardrails, it’s essential to identify factors that could lead to reputational damage or erode trust in the model. These factors might include an inappropriate tone that doesn’t align with the brand, ineffective or incorrectly generated answers, biased or harmful language, or toxic content. Tools like the Moderator API and LLM Guard can effectively review model outputs before sharing them with users. However, merely controlling harmful and toxic content is not enough – responses must also be factually correct, free of hallucinations, reliable, and accurate.

    "content": "Article March 5, 2025 by Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI The key to AI adoption. A GenAI series 2/4 In our previous discussion on the evolving landscape of Generative AI (GenAI), we explored how the rapid advancements in AI accessibility, particularly with OpenAI’s solutions, have shaped the market. With wider adoption, questions of societal readiness and responsibility keep rising when we talk about policies and innovation. Let me explain. Read series part 1 Service Data and AI Industry Enterprise The success of GenAI hinges on trust. People will embrace AI in their daily routines only if they see it as safe, reliable, and valuable. However, trust isn’t automatic—it must be built through transparency, control, and ethical implementation by companies developing AI solutions. What it means is that b eyond corporate responsibility, the broader societal impact of AI adoption must be carefully considered, particularly in education and policy-making. In Estonia, OpenAI and the Estonian government have launched an initiative to provide secondary school students and teachers with access to ChatGPT Edu—a version tailored for educational use. The rollout will begin with 10th and 11th graders by September 2025. Such initiatives are needed and can only thrive when trust in AI is firmly established, ensuring alignment between technological progress and societal expectations. Now applying the same readiness to organizations, challenges are similar. In the early days of GenAI, concerns around data security, ethics, and reliability led to hesitation. While skepticism persists, transparency is key to overcoming these barriers. Organizations must clearly define AI’s role, communicate its capabilities and limitations, and establish responsible AI policies. Setting realistic expectations and continuously educating users will be critical in fostering confidence in AI’s potential. The need for transparent and reasonable AI control Control is a major factor influencing trust in AI. Companies need to strike a balance between AI’s power and ensuring it operates within ethical and regulatory boundaries. AI governance should not be about restricting innovation but rather about implementing structured frameworks that enable responsible AI use. A well-defined AI governance framework should include: – AI Readiness Assessment: Organizations should establish AI maturity matrixes to evaluate their preparedness for AI integration. This can help identify potential risks, gaps, and areas requiring improvement. – Human Oversight: AI should be developed and deployed with human supervision, ensuring critical decision-making processes remain accountable. – Ethical and Regulatory Compliance: Companies must comply with industry-specific regulations and ethical standards while deploying AI-driven solutions. Take the AI readiness assessment AI as a compliance enabler: the case for regulatory agents Interestingly, while AI itself is under scrutiny for regulation, it is also proving to be a valuable compliance tool. One of the most impactful applications of AI is its ability to help organizations within complex regulatory environments. For instance, we developed a Regulatory Agent for a client operating in a heavily regulated industry. The challenge was great—regulations were changing daily, requiring immediate updates to compliance-related documents. GenAI played a crucial role in automating compliance processes, ensuring that regulatory requirements were met in real time, and reducing the risk of non-compliance. This example highlights a paradox: AI, which is often viewed with skepticism, is simultaneously an enabler of transparency and compliance. This duality emphasizes the importance of control mechanisms that do not stifle AI’s potential but rather enhance its responsible use. Read more about Regulatory Assistant Transparency, maturity, and education For AI to thrive in business environments, organizations must prioritize these key areas: data structure and quality, infrastructure utilization, ethics and compliance, AI expertise, and leadership support. AI is here to stay, and its role will only grow in shaping industries and workplaces. The key to successful AI adoption is trust, built through transparency, ethical governance, and proactive education. As organizations navigate this evolving landscape, they must ensure that AI serves as an enabler rather than a disruptor—balancing innovation with responsibility. How? By establishing clear frameworks for AI adoption and compliance, we can foster an environment where AI is trusted, valued, and seamlessly integrated into everyday operations. Then we stay open and honest about all the advancements and ensure the team is on board with the developments. The question is not just about regulating AI but about ensuring its ethical and beneficial use in a rapidly evolving digital world.

    "title": "Elevating data quality with Generative AI",
    "content": "Home Insights Elevating data quality with Generative AI Article January 23, 2024 by Dillon Dayton, Solutions Architect Elevating data quality with Generative AI In today’s world, data is the currency of innovation, and businesses are looking to Generative AI (GenAI) to solve their data issues. We’ll navigate the uncharted waters of how GenAI can mitigate the risks of poor data quality and cultivate an ecosystem of reliable, enriched data. Service Data and AI Industry Consumer Enterprise Healthcare Data is the cornerstone of informed decision-making, strategic foresight, and competitive edge. However, the persistent challenge of ensuring the integrity of data quality remains an ongoing struggle. Conventional approaches fall short in today’s dynamic information landscape. Data arrives from a myriad of sources, in diverse formats, at unprecedented speeds that make traditional methods of quality assurance inadequate. This is where GenAI steps onto the stage, presenting a paradigm shift that redefines how enterprises can ensure data quality. GenAI, a culmination of advanced machine learning and neural network technologies, holds the promise of not just identifying and rectifying data discrepancies, but also of intelligently generating high-quality data. It’s an innovation that transforms the role of AI from being a passive analyzer to an active participant in data enhancement. Let’s explore the most common data quality issues in organizations, how generative AI can help solve or mitigate them, and look at a real-world scenario that demonstrates how generative AI can be used to drive real business value. In the pursuit of success and innovation, we recognize there are far-reaching consequences of poor data quality. Consider the following consequences to data accuracy and integrity Inaccurate Decision-Making Poor data quality threatens the very bedrock of insightful and sound analyses. Business strategies, conceived and executed based on unreliable data, not only run the risk of misdirection but also incur financial losses and missed opportunities. Lost Revenue Inaccurate customer data, ranging from flawed contact details to incomplete purchase histories, directly undermines sales potential and chips away at customer satisfaction. The pernicious billing errors stemming from data inaccuracies manifest as revenue leakage. Customer Dissatisfaction Incorrect or outdated customer information begets woeful customer experiences, such as inundating patrons with irrelevant offers or out-of-touch communications. The collateral damage is substantial, including tarnished brand reputation and eroded customer loyalty. Operational Inefficiencies Inaccurate data ripples through business processes, disrupting supply chains with misplaced inventory data, leading to overstocking or stockouts. This operational chaos incurs lost sales, inflated costs, and disgruntled customers. Regulatory Compliance Risks In an era of stringent data regulations, poor data quality thrusts enterprises into a dangerous tango with non-compliance. The ramifications are dire—penalties, legal entanglements, and the enduring stain on reputation. Reduced Trust in Data When employees and stakeholders continually encounter errors or inconsistencies in data, trust in that data crumbles. Often due to business users creating their own version of the data creating confusion and repeated work. This overall skepticism can translate into a reluctance to rely on data for decision-making, impairing overall enterprise performance. Strained Relationships Poor data quality wreaks havoc on relationships with partners, suppliers, and customers. Inaccurate data sows the seeds of misunderstandings and disputes, fracturing critical alliances and forfeiting future opportunities. Harnessing the Power of GenAI for Your Needs There are many risks that come with continuing to live with poor data quality, but harnessing GenAI offers a wide spectrum of capabilities to help mitigate those risks. From identifying anomalies that signal data quality concerns to streamlining the arduous process of data labeling and cleansing, GenAI stands as a transformative force in an enterprise powered by data. Consider how these intelligent algorithms can reshape the way your organization approaches data quality. Data cleansing: Generating code or scripts for tasks such as parsing, formatting, imputing missing values, and identifying data quality issues, streamlining the data cleaning process and improving efficiency. Labeling and Tagging: Generative models can assist in generating initial labels, tags, and annotations, which can then be refined by human experts in governance or ML applications. Anomaly detection: Learn the normal patterns of data and identify anomalies or outliers that deviate from these patterns. Data imputation: Impute missing values in datasets. By learning patterns from existing data, these models can predict and generate plausible values for missing or incomplete data points. Synthetic Data generation and testing: Create synthetic datasets that mimic the distribution of real-world data. These datasets can be used for testing, validation, and training. Real-World Scenario with Generative AI Consider a prominent research hospital specializing in dermatology and oncology that aims to advance the accuracy of its skin cancer identification models. The hospital’s machine learning team is facing a significant challenge due to the limited availability of diverse and high-quality skin cancer images for training and testing their algorithms. Traditional methods of collecting such data are time-consuming, expensive, and can raise privacy concerns. As previously discussed, a practical application of GenAI is to create synthetic datasets that mimic the distribution of real-world data. These datasets can be used for testing, validation, and training. For our research hospital they feel to overcome their challenges, they need to leverage this technique to create synthetic test data specifically tailored for skin cancer identification models. Benefits: Enhanced Model Performance: The AI-generated synthetic data significantly increases the volume and diversity of the training dataset, resulting in improved model performance and generalization. Privacy and Ethical Compliance: Using synthetic data minimizes privacy concerns and ethical issues associated with using real patient images, as the synthetic data does not contain identifiable information. Cost-Efficiency: Creating synthetic data is cost-effective compared to the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating real images. Faster Development: The hospital can expedite the development and deployment of skin cancer identification models by relying on generative AI for data augmentation.

    "content": "Article May 6, 2025 by Nortal Beyond copilots: The rise of AI agents and enterprise AI Autonomous and integrated AI is more than a collection of copilots – it’s a strategic necessity. Service Data and AI Copilots won’t transform your business. Autonomous AI agents will. The AI conversation has been dominated by personal assistants and copilots - tools that help individuals work faster. But the real value of AI isn’t in helping a few employees write quicker emails or summarize documents. The next frontier is far more transformative: autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI . These aren’t just tools. They are strategic assets - AI systems that learn, act, and make decisions across your organization without constant human oversight. While copilots assist, AI agents can operate, optimize, and orchestrate entire business functions . The companies already building these capabilities aren’t just getting more efficient - they're redefining how they compete, serve customers, and create new value. In this article, we’ll explore: What autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI really are Why copilots are no longer enough The levels of automation and how to evolve toward autonomy Real-world use cases showing how leaders in manufacturing, public services, and supply chains are using AI agents today The conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) often centers on personal tools like copilots and other AI assistants that can help with specific tasks at different levels of the organization. However, AI's true potential and value extend far beyond these tools. The two concepts that will transform how businesses operate and compete - and that every decision-maker should watch - are autonomous AI agents and Enterprise AI . What are AI agents and Enterprise AI, and why should you care? AI agents refer to AI systems designed to act independently, make decisions, and perform tasks without constant human intervention. They can learn from data, adapt to new information, and execute complex processes, making them invaluable in dynamic environments. Enterprise AI, conversely, encompasses a broader integration of AI technologies across an organization's entire ecosystem. This includes holistic data management and analytics in functions and processes from finance to procurement and from customer service to supply chain optimization. Enterprise AI aims to enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and drive innovation by leveraging AI at every business level. It is about creating a cohesive strategy that aligns with the company's goals and processes. The need for autonomous agents and Enterprise AI arises from the limitations of the known personal AI applications like copilots. While copilots can assist with specific tasks, they lack the autonomy and scalability to address modern enterprises' complex challenges. Businesses today need AI solutions that can operate independently, integrate seamlessly with existing systems and business processes, and provide actionable insights that drive growth and efficiency. Essentially, they transform AI from a helpful assistant into a strategic partner that propels the business forward. The s tepwise e volution t owards a utonomous AI a gents While the first wave of generative AI brought us copilots and other personal AI assistants, it didn’t yet revolutionize our lives as advertised—or feared, depending on the viewpoint. Some even labelled the copilots as Clippy 2.0 , referring to the notorious Microsoft Office assistant from the late 90s. While copilots have advantages over Clippy, assistants for humans can only increase productivity to a point. The transformation from AI assistants to autonomous agents will revolutionize entire processes and how we do business. However, transitioning from manual human-led processes to full automation involves going through different levels, ranging from simple task automation to fully autonomous decision-making systems. The levels of automation can be categorized as follows: Manual Systems: human intervention for all tasks and decision-making Assisted Automation: AI systems provide recommendations and insights, humans make decisions Partial Automation: human oversight for complex decisions, but AI systems perform tasks autonomously Conditional Automation: AI systems handle most tasks, but human intervention needed in limited conditions or scenarios High Automation: minimal human intervention, AI systems perform most tasks autonomously Full Automation: AI systems are independent, make decisions and execute without human involvement Smarter Decision-Making : AI helps businesses process vast amounts of data, enabling leaders to make informed decisions quickly. From predictive analytics to real-time insights, AI empowers organizations to capture opportunities faster than ever before. Operational Efficiency : By automating routine tasks, AI frees up human resources to focus on more strategic, value-adding initiatives. This leads to cost savings, improved productivity, and enhanced operational capabilities. Customer Experience : AI’s ability to personalize customer interactions in real time leads to higher satisfaction, loyalty, and competitive advantage. With AI-driven customer insights, businesses can anticipate needs, reduce friction, and drive long-term relationships. Innovation and Growth : AI is not just about automation - it’s about unlocking new value streams . Whether it’s enhancing product offerings or creating entirely new business models, AI opens the door to new growth opportunities. 1 2 3 4 When climbing higher up on the automation level, data and AI solutions built for analytical and user-interface-focused needs will not suffice. New API-driven solutions are needed to drive and automate complex business processes without human intervention. By understanding and leveraging these different levels of automation, organizations can gradually transition from manual systems to fully autonomous agents, unlocking new opportunities for efficiency and innovation. Despite the breathtaking speed of advancements and changes in the AI landscape, the shift to fully autonomous systems making independent decisions will not happen overnight. From our perspective, human oversight will still be needed in the short term. Capturing the value of Enterprise AI While some of Enterprise AI's value lies in increasing operational efficiency and unlocking the full potential of a company's data assets and processes, it ultimately enables organizations to discover new value streams, rethink their core processes, and innovate new businesses. To successfully implement Enterprise AI, an organization needs a solid data and AI strategy backed up by a scalable enterprise architecture. The strategy defines a clear vision and key performance indicators (KPI). It directs the supporting governance structure and builds a robust data platform that includes secure data storage, efficient processing capabilities, and scalable cloud solutions. Seamless integration with existing operational and IT systems and processes requires interfaces and middleware that connect various data sources and applications within your organization. Our next article will discuss building data governance models and platforms in more detail. Once prerequisites are met, adopting Enterprise AI can be transformative. It enhances decision-making by leveraging vast data for actionable insights, leading to better strategies and a competitive edge. It boosts operational efficiency by automating tasks, reducing costs, and freeing up human resources for strategic initiatives. Enterprise AI can help personalize customer experiences in real time, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. Predictive analytics enables anticipating trends, behaviors, and risks, allowing businesses to mitigate challenges and seize opportunities. AI agents in action: examples from our customer verticals Business leaders may still be skeptical about integrating AI into the highest levels of strategic and tactical work. This might be due to security or privacy concerns, a lack of understanding of using and incorporating the tools into the core processes, or just mere fear of being “replaced by machines.” Luckily, we at Nortal have had the privilege to work with some of the most forward-thinking organizations in Northern Europe to envision the potential of AI agents and Enterprise AI. Here are some examples of use-case scenarios from our focus verticals. Manufacturing: Real-time energy optimization AI-powered solutions can continuously monitor and adjust energy usage in real-time, splitting tasks between AI and human agents. They go beyond traditional energy management systems by learning from historical patterns, forecasting demand, and automating energy-intensive tasks during off-peak hours. Public Sector: Automating citizen services In public services like building permit applications, AI agents can interpret free-text requests, auto-fill regulatory forms, and generate draft decisions using RAG-based models. Human staff can review and approve these drafts, while the system learns and improves over time. IT/OT Integration: Smarter factory setup AI agents can accelerate factory setup by automating tasks like asset hierarchy creation, device integration, and anomaly detection. They scan networks, update management systems, and tag IoT data for business intelligence systems in real time. Procurement: Autonomous machine customers Enterprise AI agents can predict price movements in raw material markets, determine optimal buying times, negotiate deals, and automate purchases. They reduce cost volatility and mitigate supply chain risks while freeing human staff for higher-value tasks. From tactical tools to strategic transformation In all the cases described here, scalable Enterprise AI and autonomous AI agents don’t just boost productivity—they fundamentally reshape how organizations innovate, adapt, and grow. They empower businesses to respond to change faster, tap into new value chains, and reimagine what is possible. The era of AI copilots is already behind us.

    "title": "From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI",
    "content": "Home Insights From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI Article May 23, 2024 by Dragan Gajic, CTO | Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI From luxury to necessity: Leveraging AI With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and foundational artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the AI landscape has undergone a seismic shift. AI is democratizing and making its benefits accessible to companies and organizations of all shapes and sizes. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Traditionally, the barrier to entry for AI adoption was high. Organizations needed substantial amounts of quality data, robust and expensive infrastructure for training models, and a skilled workforce proficient in machine learning and data science. Consequently, only big tech companies could afford the investment required to harness the power of AI effectively. However, the emergence of large language models has drastically reduced these barriers, making AI accessible to businesses of all sizes and industries. Creating the right AI solution for your organization doesn’t have to take significant investments in teams and hardware anymore. And with the competition in the GenAI market heating up, the price is pressed to come down even more in the next five years. Today, AI is no longer a luxury but a necessity for gaining a competitive edge in the market. How to win with AI In Gartner’s 2023 poll of more than 1,400 executive leaders, 45% reported that they are in piloting mode with generative AI, and another 10% have put generative AI solutions into production. And as an assurance to their investments, an Accenture study reveals that companies that adopt AI early and comprehensively show higher profit margins and improved performance compared to their peers. But beyond mere competitiveness, organizations leverage AI to streamline internal processes and enhance operational efficiency. Business processes are the very core of every organization and making these more efficient is what really makes the difference. The real win comes from making your organization work better. However, like often with many technologies, in business, much of AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Even more, it is important to focus on the problem that needs to be solved rather than the approach that will be used. The biggest value lies in knowing your business and having the tools to solve possible problems and make the processes more efficient. When we understand the challenge, the most appropriate approach will emerge for addressing it, be it a combination of different LLM models to achieve the best quality or an on-premises solution to protect your data. The importance of data in AI There is no AI without data. That is what it is trained on; that is what it eats. However, a popular saying goes: Garbage in, garbage out. It even has its own often-used acronym GIGO. In short, poor data produces poor results. If the data you use for your AI tool is of poor quality or faulty, it is unlikely that good or truthful results will be achieved by applying LLMs to the data. It is important not to overlook the significance of having a robust data architecture, high-quality data, and well-designed interfaces for interacting with the data. Seamless experiences: AI shaping productivity and ways of working We believe that at the core of this AI-driven transformation lies the concept of seamless experiences. Whether it’s improving customer interactions or enhancing employee productivity, the goal remains the same: to create frictionless experiences. In EY’s 2023 Work Reimagined survey of both employee and employer survey respondents, a net positive 33% see AI’s potential benefits for productivity and new ways of working, with a net positive 44% seeing benefits to the reality of flexible working. By leveraging AI-driven tools and solutions, organizations can streamline mundane tasks, leading to a rise in strategic actions and personalized experiences. That is also driving AI toward near-future developments centered around human-machine collaboration. By delegating monotonous and time-consuming tasks to computers, we free up valuable time and cognitive resources to focus on strategic decision-making. Gartner predicts that by 2026, over 100 million humans will engage robocolleagues to contribute to their work. And that by 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop. This is not happening at all today. For software companies, integrating AI into their own work processes and solutions is no longer optional but imperative. Data and AI have become indispensable software development components, enabling companies to deliver innovative, intelligent, and value-generating solutions to their customers. According to Accenture , AI is projected to boost labor productivity by up to 40% by 2035, unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation across industries. Get on board or get left behind Where to get started with your AI adoption? There is a common myth that AI projects take years to complete. But the evolution of AI is so fast that you cannot afford to have huge, 2-year projects. But unlike a myth, the fact is that a lot can be delivered with 2-3 months. Before the wide public adoption of large language models, following the leading edge with ChatGPT as the frontrunner, we built our data and analysis solution, Tark . Tark has helped our customers analyze and visualize their structured and unstructured data and generate insights and recommendations for continuous improvement. Learn more Catalyst for organizational change To create seamless experiences, we must be technology agnostic and early adopters. Because of this belief and the actions behind it, we can leverage our long experience in data and AI projects to save time and money for our customers. AI is not merely a technology but a catalyst for organizational transformation. To thrive in today’s fast-paced and competitive landscape, businesses must be agile, adaptive, and efficient. Embracing new technologies and leveraging data-driven insights are critical to achieving operational excellence and driving sustainable growth. In the Gartner poll , 78% of respondents believe that the benefits of generative AI outweigh its risks, and this number has risen since the previous poll. However, privacy should not be pushed aside to take advantage of GenAI. We believe that fully understanding the importance of the discovery phase can mitigate many of the risks – to truly know your company’s goals, where it stands, and the limitations of your AI project. For example, it is possible to choose which data to use, run your GenAI solution completely on-premises if you do not feel comfortable using the cloud, or create a hybrid solution in which some of the data sits on the cloud and more sensitive data is kept on-premises. The key is knowing your possibilities and tailoring your GenAI solution to your exact needs with the right authorization matrix. The same goes for ethics. While AI holds immense potential, it also raises critical ethical concerns that demand careful consideration. Generative AI models are usually trained on vast amounts of uncontrolled data that can amplify existing biases or breach copyright laws. While data diversity and model governance can alleviate some of the risks, it is important that the models be transparent, that clear human oversight still remains over their results, and that clear accountability and liability mechanisms are established. Even though AI is evolving quickly, it is still considered an emerging technology with its own risks. Therefore, in delivering AI solutions, we know it is important not to overpromise, be transparent, and work closely with the client. The key to unlocking AI’s full potential is its application to real-world business cases. From automating repetitive tasks to optimizing resource allocation, AI-powered solutions can address a myriad of challenges faced by organizations across various industries. By collaborating with AI experts and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, businesses can unlock new opportunities, drive innovation, and stay ahead of the curve.

Download the full white paper Empowering users with means that traditional services cannot One of the most significant problems still to be solved in public administration and service delivery is to provide equitable and high-quality public services sustainably. Traditionally, only another human could render services in a way that felt human. But now, we can surpass human capability to deliver high-quality services while assuring the sustainable renewal of services. We have learned that by simplifying complex processes and the intelligent use of technology, we can increase public approval and efficiency – at the same time. Digital is the means to an end, not the point itself While personal government requires and evolves from the strong digital government foundation, the emphasis is on simply providing a better public service experience and efficient public administration. Many organizations (including the World Bank and OECD) have started to call the equivalent evolutionary step from the digital government era the GovTech era. In this era people have more control over their data to build trust. Services are shifting from a government-focused to a citizen-centered approach. Modern platforms provide smoother experiences and foster innovation. And AI can step in where current methods fall short, making service delivery more efficient. Envisioning the next era for public services To explore public services in the era of personal government, we highlight five key traits: human-centricity, accessibility, proactiveness, trustworthiness, and empowerment. Ready to journey to the Personal Government The full realization of the goals of personal government requires the adoption of emerging technologies and the reorganization of the government’s working principles in terms of service provision and cooperation between institutions.

    "title": "Whitepaper Proactive Public Services",
    "content": "White Paper June 19, 2023 Proactive Public Services – the new standard for digital governments Following the first wave of public sector digitization that focused on making services accessible online, governments are seeking to increasingly automate public services, so that they require as little interaction from users and service providers as possible. Proactive public services represent the pinnacle of this new wave of digital public services. In their most sophisticated form, these digital public services can be designed entirely without user interaction, offering unparalleled frictionless access to public services. Download the full white paper Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Government Transformation This white paper aims to help those who wish to understand, and potentially develop, proactive public services. It discusses the concept of proactive public services as the next phase of digitization in the public sector. The paper showcases examples from Austria, Estonia, and New Zealand, where proactive public services of differing levels of sophistication have been developed, implemented, and trialed for several years. Drawing on these cases, the paper presents new insights and lessons learned, identifies the core building blocks for developing proactive public services, and concludes by offering recommendations on how to successfully transition to a more proactive public sector. User-friendly government services With minimal user interaction required, Proactive public services are at the cutting-edge of service design by being as user-friendly as possible. Yet, their potential to increase the effectiveness of policies underlying public services is even more remarkable. Redesigning public services into proactive public services extends their reach by making it unnecessary for potential users to even be aware of them or must apply for them. This may especially benefit the most socially disadvantaged groups in society, who often already have the hardest journey for obtaining government services. Wide-scale introduction of proactive public services may therefore even contribute to a more socially just and equitable society. Implementing proactive public services at scale requires organizational capabilities, stakeholder management, and evaluating each public service’s potential for proactive delivery. Governments need to raise awareness, build necessary foundations, and develop capabilities to successfully implement proactive public services. Download the full white paper Improved service delivery efficiency At the same time, proactive public services can help push the boundaries of automation in the delivery of public services as governments face mounting pressure to harness digitization to improve service delivery efficiency. Proactive public services can help governments fulfill citizens’ increasing expectations that digital public services be provided with the same user friendliness as private sector digital services. It also has the potential to reduce costs and required personnel, freeing up public funds to tackle the most pressing challenges of our time, such as climate change, and mitigating the impact of increasing labor shortages in the public sector, which confront many developed countries. Proactive public services are part of a wider transformation towards proactive government that delivers users public services without waiting for formal requests. It implies a capacity to anticipate societal and economic developments, as well as users’ needs, by capturing real-time information and applying it to re-design services. Some of the most digitally advanced nations in the world have begun the path towards proactive government by successfully implementing the first proactive public services. However, even the most digitally advanced nations have only been able to implement a small number of proactive public services to date. Their experience shows that building these services is significantly more complex than other types of digital public services. Creating sophisticated proactive public services requires a strong foundation of environmental, technical, and organizational building blocks. This includes a supportive regulatory environment that enables the inter-agency exchange of personal data, a requirement to implement many advanced proactive public services. A high level of trust in the public sector is also essential to create a desire to experiment with and transition to this mode of digital public services and ensure continuous support for it. Proactive public services aim to automate public services to minimize user and service provider interaction, providing frictionless access to government services. This approach not only enhances user-friendliness but also has the potential to increase policy effectiveness and promote social equity.

Electronic messaging Secure and legally binding electronic messaging between the public sector, citizens, and businesses. Transforming into a proactive government requires comprehensive preparation The complexity of implementing proactive public services at scale is nothing short of a stress test for public administrations’ organizational capabilities. Re-designing digital public services from a reactive to a proactive approach demands an in-depth understanding of the processes and organizations involved, as well as the ability and mindset to completely re-think them. Implementing proactive public services will often drastically increase the complexity of stakeholder management as it often requires cooperation between several government agencies. These foundational factors combined with the individual characteristics of each public service determine whether a public service can be re-designed as a proactive public service, and how far its delivery can be automated. Download the white paper Building the necessary foundation and capabilities To start implementing proactive public services, public administrations must understand its possibilities and evaluate the potential for each public service. This white paper’s accompanying materials offer guidance on how to evaluate public services’ potential to be delivered as a proactive public service. A set of guiding questions is published to help interested public service providers evaluate individual public services regarding their suitability to be delivered proactively. Due to this transformation’s wide-ranging implications, it will require politicians, civil service leaders and the public’s continuous support. Thus, a first step must be to raise awareness of proactive government’s potential, as well as realistic expectations of the time and effort needed for this transformation. Experimenting and implementing less sophisticated types of proactive public services, such as proactive information, may be useful to gain experience and raise awareness, even for governments that lack the right foundation. However, a full-scale transformation to proactive government is unlikely to succeed without a solid foundation of technical building blocks and the right public administration capabilities. Providing proactive public services must become a question of “how” and “when” – not “if”.

    "content": "The state of AI-ready data in local government New insights from UK councils on standards, readiness and reform, and how public data is evolving to support search, machine learning and generative AI. Read the research report Service Digital Transformation Industry Government The councils that modernise their data will modernise their services fastest. Across the UK, local authorities are discovering that data is no longer a by-product of bureaucracy but the raw material for automation. When structured for search, prediction and conversation, it cuts costs, sharpens policy and powers a new wave of citizen-centred services. Local governments’ datasets are no longer about accountability alone; they are becoming the fuel of automation. Where readiness meets results Ten case studies, from Dorset’s predictive budgeting to London’s fire-risk modelling, reveal both progress and fragmentation. Most councils now publish open data, but few prepare it for reuse. Machine-readable metadata remains scarce, and standards are patchy. Where they do align – ISO dates, UPRNs, SNOMED CT – AI tools deliver faster insights, more accurate forecasts and measurable savings. The evidence is clear: readiness is not about scale or budget, but about the discipline of standards and governance. Read the case studies These variations point to a deeper truth: AI is not a single capability but a family of tools, each with its own data demands. Different AIs, different data demands AI readiness is too often treated as a box to tick. In reality, what makes data “fit for AI” depends on the purpose. The datasets that drive a chatbot will fail a forecasting model; what works for search may break predictive analytics. For councils, recognising these distinctions is essential to making sound investments. Efficiency and democracy are not competing goals Efficiency and democracy reinforce one another. The white paper argues that operational performance, state capacity and public trust, core measures of efficiency, depend on the same values that sustain democracy: transparency, accountability and pluralism. Centralized systems may deliver quick wins but often weaken resilience and trust. Federated, modular designs take longer yet build adaptability, sustainability and sovereignty. From data maturity to data purpose ODI and Nortal propose a framework that treats readiness as a toolkit, not a ladder: Search readiness: clean metadata, canonical identifiers and machine-readable schemas. Machine-learning readiness: structured, balanced data at scale with clear provenance. Generative-AI readiness: annotated corpora and APIs built for retrieval and conversation. Search readiness underpins transparency and efficiency; machine-learning readiness supports foresight and planning; and generative readiness opens the door to new forms of citizen interaction. Each requires its own standards, governance and infrastructure, but together they give councils flexible pathways to modernise services and build trust. These are not stages of maturity but lenses of purpose – transparency, foresight and trust – giving councils practical routes to modernise services without waiting for perfect systems. Explore the framework Decisions make data ready, or not Every dataset reflects a decision — about structure, standard, governance or neglect. Those choices shape whether councils can anticipate crises or merely record them. The report offers a toolkit for turning data into capability: adopt standards, publish metadata, automate pipelines and separate operational from strategic data.

    "content": "Best practices in public procurement for continuous modernization Use outcome-driven procurement for innovation, resilience and efficiency Download the playbook Service Digital Transformation Industry Government Governments struggle to modernize mission-critical systems Finance, justice, social welfare, health care and defense all rely on government IT – too often built on fragile, decades-old infrastructure. Traditional procurement (long contracts, rigid specs, big-bang delivery) drives overruns, delays and solutions that miss user needs. The result is rising technical debt, mounting cyber risk and high-profile failures when large replacements collapse under their own weight. In the United States alone, more than $100 billion a year goes to federal IT, much of it just to keep legacy systems running. Doing nothing is not sustainable as public expectations keep rising. The system that created the barriers can dismantle them. Procurement is a strategic lever for change and innovation Public procurement is not just an administrative process. In many countries it represents 12% to 15% of GDP – enough market power to shape innovation, competitiveness and how public services evolve. Used well, it can unlock cutting-edge solutions and preserve public control over critical infrastructure and data. Used poorly, it can stall digital transformation. Learn more in the playbook Public procurement accounts for 12–15% of GDP in many countries – a tremendous influence on markets and innovation. A modular, adaptive procurement approach The private sector modernizes continuously – short cycles, iterative upgrades and faster integration of new tech without disrupting service. Governments can do the same when procurement rules enable agility, innovation and collaboration while safeguarding accountability. Shifting to continuous modernization requires clear goals that balance innovation with stewardship. Seven shifts for procurement reform Enable continuous innovation. Replace one-off projects with flexible, outcome-based contracts and agile pilots. Grow the ecosystem. Use procurement to stimulate domestic industry, small businesses and startups while pulling innovation into the market. Open the door wider. Simplify tenders and split work into smaller lots so more diverse suppliers can compete. Focus on value, not just cost. Use life-cycle criteria such as most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) to deliver the best outcomes per taxpayer dollar. Advance sustainability and social value. Embed green standards, accessibility and fair labor in tenders. Protect trust through transparency . Ensure open competition, clear rules, auditability and open contracting data. Safeguard sovereignty and resilience. Maintain national oversight of critical data and infrastructure, avoid lock-in and build in cybersecurity from the start.

    "content": "Home Insights Bettering bureaucracy with a Single Digital Gateway Case study August 22, 2024 Bettering bureaucracy with a Single Digital Gateway Together with Estonia’s Information System Authority, Nortal has created a GovTech system that powers Estonia’s integration into the European single market by enabling information-sharing across 26 EU countries, all at different stages of digitalization, all with different backend systems. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government This system aligns with the EU’s Single Digital Gateway (SDG) mandate—a legislative directive aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles across Europe. You’re a Belgian who wants to retire and collect her pension in Spain. You’re a German entrepreneur whose business pays taxes in Ireland and France. We’ve built the technology that makes this possible, one which allows Estonian citizens to share over 250 legal certificates, in 48 areas of citizen information, throughout 46 business systems—all with 26 other nations. It’s a system that unites nations at different stages of their digitalization journeys, nations with disparate data, and makes the single market truly single. Cross-border chaos Cross-border paperwork is an unavoidable feature of any single market. The administrative process must be unified to enable university student exchange programs, to register a car in another domicile, and enable entrepreneurs to start businesses abroad. Every nation’s paperwork requirements are different, and requirements may differ at institutions within a nation. One university in Spain may want your high school diploma, another requires proof of income eligibility for scholarships. Different documents are needed and they are uploaded and downloaded on different platforms. When accessing hundreds of legacy systems across which data is scattered, users’ documents are located in a variety of government offices working in silos, making it time consuming to get documents for opening a business, changing schools, or any other bureaucratic task. Multiple log-ins may be required to chase down information and, at the personal level, it becomes an exercise in frustration. At the societal level, it’s a massive waste of resources. Calculations show that for the European Union, a single digital gateway (SDG) could help companies save 11 billion euros, and relieve citizens of 885,000 hours of labor. The single digital gateway For Europe, the solution is the SDG. The system is flexible enough to allow nations and organizations to keep their own systems, choose their own technology, yet it creates an SDG layer which enables sharing. For citizen and business it means controlling their own data, with documents retrieved and shared automatically within the single market. Our solution, developed in close collaboration with the Estonian Information System Authority, included strategy and innovation consulting for legal changes in state law and was delivered in four months to the Estonia Information System Authority. It was tested in 63 cases in cooperation with eight other member nations of the European Union. Future-proof architecture We applied a broad architectural approach in Estonia as it continues to learn how the SDG fits into the Estonian architectural landscape, and works to ensure scalability in response to potential EU changes. For example, considerations include how an ID matching application will function in the future and how it will integrate into the SDG workflow. GovSSO (single sign-on) is incorporated in solution design, meaning a good user experience with significantly fewer sign-ons. We embraced testing and actively participated in all EU-held technical and business roundtable meetings and joint conformance testing events. Although these are not mandatory, they offer valuable insights into future application functionalities and opportunities for early improvements. Killing it with KPIs In just six months, Nortal built a fully functioning system for Estonia, exceeding the KPIs set by the Estonian Information System Authority by 230%. Developed from scratch, this system earned top recognition at a Europe-wide testing event , further validating its outstanding performance. The implementation of the single digital gateway is estimated to save Estonia three- to four million euros in direct costs, as well as a similar amount in future maintenance costs. The full development of the intermediary platform was completed in just 12 months. Over the next three year, Estonia’s full implementation will be built out to encompass the entire infrastructure, and it is all being constructed in accordance to EU specifications at a budget manageable by the Estonian state. But just as diverse, dispersed data is not just a European problem, SDGs are not just a European solution. In any nation or government where there are de-centralized states, provinces, or entities, the situation is the same – disunity, inconsistency, and a plethora of legacy systems. But the citizen does not have to suffer.

    "content": "Home Insights Estonia moves towards a seamless society with proactive public services Case study October 3, 2022 Estonia moves towards a seamless society with proactive public services Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Proactive government services aim to make easy, convenient, and efficient public services available for citizens to save them time and resources, but most importantly, to create a state that keeps citizens’ needs at its very core. Estonia, a country widely regarded as a truly digital society, made yet another innovative leap at the end of 2019 by launching proactive family and parental benefits, moving toward a new proactive governance model. Rethinking digitalization Innovation in government services is not simply moving its services online but foreseeing its citizens’ needs and providing support throughout key events in their lives, whether it is the birth of a child, purchasing a home, or retirement. This presumes an active role from the state, requiring a redesign of reactive government processes into event-based services. The new method significantly simplifies citizens’ lives by turning burdensome bureaucracy into a seamless user experience and proactive aid to those in need. Challenge Fragmented information The main challenge with reactive public services is that citizens need to contact the state to determine the rights and benefits to which they are entitled. Often, this requires visiting a government office, examining voluminous information, and submitting numerous agency applications. Meanwhile, the citizens most in need of government support are also the most at risk if required to manage these complexities. Estonia’s first proactive service of family and parental benefits aims to make life easier for parents. Before this, the information was fragmented, and parents lacked confidence that they had the necessary details about the applicable benefits. Furthermore, there was zero automation, and only 15% of benefits were based on offers. And even those proposals were processed by hand, resulting in laborious manual work for state officials and taking up to 65 minutes to process one person’s application. Solution Parental benefits with a click of a button In October 2019, parents in Estonia received a proactive offer for benefits for the first time via self-service portal. This means that parents of a newborn no longer need to apply for benefits but receive a proactive proposal from the government for the benefits they are entitled to, which they simply have to confirm. When a child is born, the entry made in the population register will activate all follow-on services without the parents having to apply. The proposal directs the parent to a self-service portal where they can accept the offer with the click of a button. The parents are informed of the benefits they are entitled to, the sum they are entitled to, the calculations their benefits are based on, when the benefits are paid out, and what they should do next. To allow this, an automated system based on complex algorithms operates in the background. This system supports a comprehensive data analysis, comprising more than 80 unique conditions to consider, which creates detailed information concerning who is eligible for benefits and in what amount. When family conditions change, the system validates data via various registers to approve the benefits and the entitled sums. Furthermore, Estonian digital services are based on the once-only principle , meaning that the government can ask citizens for their information only once. When needed, the same information can be requested by other public administration offices via secure data exchange. Proactive services, thus, utilize the databases and registries that already hold extensive information about citizens. When the proposal for benefits is sent proactively, all the data is collected from these databases, making it unnecessary for the citizen to provide that same information repeatedly. Once a country defines the problem and identifies the target group, it can quickly deliver benefits to those in need. 91% customer satisfaction with the proactive public service 88% reduction in direct customer contacts per month for state officials 99,99% of registered births are checked automatically to determine eligibility for parental benefits Result Anticipating citizens’ needs Today, 99.99% of registered births in Estonia are checked automatically to determine eligibility for parental benefits. Therefore, new parents can devote their time to a new family member instead of dealing with paperwork and validating if their rights are served, and they have all the information needed. Furthermore, due to proactive services, state officials have more resources to direct their efforts into providing quality service and information to citizens. When automated processes take care of most of the standard cases, state officials have more time to pay attention to special cases. For example, when people eligible for benefits would not apply, whether by lack of awareness or other reasons, thereby reducing the number of non-take-up cases. Impact A state that serves its citizens Proactive public services are the future because of the simplicity of services for citizens and the government. It saves time and resources by eliminating the need for citizens to visit government offices and for officials to process each application’s data manually. The government offers its services and aid proactively. However, what is unique about proactive public services, in addition to their seamless user experience, is the matter of social justice. Proactive public services help ensure government policies are effective and reach the people for whom they are intended. Finally, the proactive service increasingly optimizes costs, generates higher added value, and significantly increases citizens’ satisfaction. Proactive Public Services – the new standard for digital governments Proactive public services aim to automate public services to minimize user and service provider interaction, providing frictionless access to government services. This approach not only enhances user-friendliness but also has the potential to increase policy effectiveness and promote social equity.

    "content": "Home Insights Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Case study September 5, 2022 Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Service Data and AI eCensus Seamless Experiences Industry Government Real-Time Economy e-Census and Statistics In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts. At the end of a tumultuous year of COVID restrictions and lockdowns in 2020, the Sultanate of Oman completed a fully register-based census on their first try. Thus, allowing the country to run a one-click census at any time and react to population changes quickly and efficiently. Government innovation The evolution of the census Throughout time, census data has been used to inform and direct policy. However, how censuses are conducted has changed with the advancement of technology. In 1440, the Incas, who didn’t have a written language, used a system of knots on strings made from llama or alpaca hair to record census data and administer their empire. In 2020, 580 years later, Oman conducted a fully-register-based census with all three registries on their first try. Oman’s method was even highlighted by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) as an international model of shifting from a traditional census to a register-based census. In the past 20 years, Oman has put a strong emphasis on digitalization. As a result, the country’s eGovernment Development Index has risen from 0.3548 (rank 98) in 2003 to 0.7749 (rank 50) in 2020. The one-click census is another excellent example of this digital transformation journey. 1993 Civil register established 2003 National Strategy for Digital Society and eGovernance 2009 National Data Centre (NDC) inaugurated 2010 Oman National Computer Emergency Readiness Team (OCERT) launched 2012 Digital Transformation program commences 2014 Government cloud G-Cloud launched 2016 Invest Easy portal launched 2017 Tax Management System for Corporate Income Tax implemented 2018 e-Justice System “Tawtheeq” launched 2020 First e-Census completed Challenge The transformation of the census in Oman Oman conducted its first census in 1993, with subsequent censuses in 2003 and 2010. The traditional census has two main drains — time and money. It costs a lot to conduct and takes time to get the results. The 2010 census combined door-to-door visits by enumerators and an online questionnaire. In total, close to 6,600 people were involved in the process, with costs ranging from salaries, transportation, and per diems to post-census analysis and publication costs. In addition, much of the data entry and processing was manual, opening it up to errors. For the 2020 census , Oman was forward-thinking and embraced innovation fully. We worked closely with the National Center for Statistics and Information to create a data processing strategy, architecture design and to develop the e-Census project. As a result, the Sultanate became one of a few countries at a global level and the first in the Arab world to conduct a census that relied entirely on data collection through administrative records. The data obtained and the indicators provided by the census are vital for enhancing Oman Vision 2040 and have important implications for the developmental planning of all sectors of the Sultanate. – Taavi Einaste, CEO, Middle East and Africa Oman’s successful fully register-based census is a huge step toward real-time decision making, which on a national level can lead to better efficiency, quicker policy-making, and happier people. Solution A fully register-based census This approach takes advantage of the input received from various administrative registers. The data is cross-referenced using advanced extract, load, and transformation practices to obtain the necessary information for census readiness. A key goal of the e-Census 2020 project was to implement population, housing, and establishment hubs that update in near real-time — as soon as an entry is made into the administrative registers. Together with the ambitious team at National Center of Statistical Information (NCSI), Nortal successfully established common data exchange standards, which were used by 24 administrative registers that provided data for the census. Using state-of-the-art technology, the e-Census 2020 solution can ingest millions of records from various administrative registers. Statistical classifications are applied using the metadata, followed by technical and logical data validation checks. The statistical authority in Oman works with aggregated data, therefore maintaining the privacy of its citizens and residents. Eventually, census methodology is applied to the data from registers, and geospatial data is processed to support the census. The output is then disseminated through the e-Census online portal. The entire process is fully automated, enabling Oman to execute an on-demand census at any time. 4.5m People counted 95% Data quality 100m+ Records processed Impact First in the Arab world On December 14, 2020, His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik endorsed the results of the e-Census 2020 of Population, Residences and Establishments, which showed that as of December 12, 2020 the population of the Sultanate stood at 4,471,148. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, the e-Census 2020 was executed on schedule. Oman became the first nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers in a single census on the first attempt. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. Oman became the first country in the GCC to achieve a 100% register-based census in 2020. 1st 1st nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers on the first attempt. 23m About 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census. 74 Only 74 employees worked on the 2020 census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. The foundation of a proactive government The e-Census is only the first step. It provides policymakers with crucial information for understanding population changes in different regions and categories to be able to plan for the future. Furthermore, it allows the government to communicate with its citizens proactively, based on their needs, preferences, and life events, such as marriage or birth of a child. For example, birth data allows the government to automatically share information about benefits and other helpful information for new parents. Or in relation to higher education, the government can use data about university students and their specializations to plan jobs and other employment enablement plans for the youth entering the job market. Designing and implementing proactive services allows the government to increase engagement and offer excellent value to its citizens and residents. – Tomy Bosco, Business Area Director It has been a real privilege to work on this project with the NCSI and the Sultanate of Oman. I think Oman is a true global trailblazer – demonstrating how technology can accelerate and enable public services. Transforming governments, transforming societies The right digital tools applied properly can dramatically transform citizen-government interaction, changing the way societies work. A digitally-enabled government is citizen-centric, proactively meeting needs when it comes to social security and taxation. It literally changes the way citizens interact with and experience their government.

    "content": "White Paper January 23, 2023 Digitalizing government services: Make it proactive, intuitive and fast Service Experience and Design Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government When it comes to government services, the citizens, residents, and businesses of a country want fast, intuitive, proactive services. Digitalization has created the perfect environment for that vision – as countries that have already developed versions of a government ‘super app’ have discovered. Challenges Invisible services The aim of a modern government is to create an environment that allows all its citizens, residents, and businesses to fulfill their own goals and dreams. In an ideal world, the best government service would be no (obvious) service. This is the future of proactive services – a world where, ideally, services are delivered so unobtrusively that the process is almost invisible. Digitalization has brought that vision within reach. Solution A unified platform The essential foundation of this vision is a platform that connects the information system and data of every government department, allowing citizens, businesses, visitors, and others to communicate efficiently with the state. For citizens and residents, this means they can access what they need and find answers to questions through a single digital environment. For businesses and investors, it means a seamless and efficient business environment. And for governments, it means greater efficiency and productivity and a flexible system that’s fit for the future. The principles for success People-centric People are the absolute focus of the system. The experience should be intuitive, relevant, and personal, with services based around life event journeys. Future facing The system should be built with the future in mind. If the foundations of the system are robust and everything is digitalized, new services can easily be added, integrated, and managed. Secure and private A single, high-security authentication point for the public sector. Citizens, institutions, and companies should only have to provide certain standard information to the authorities and administrations once. – Forbes Estonia has given an entirely different outlook on what a truly human-centric society entails for digital citizens. The evolution of e-services worldwide While businesses have been at the forefront of the drive to harness the potential of e-services, a small number of countries worldwide are leading the way in digital government. In Malta and Portugal, for example, around 98% of government services are available online. In 2020, the E-Government Development Index ranked the 193 United Nations Member States in terms of digital government. Denmark, the Republic of Korea, and Estonia ranked as the most developed. The rapid shift from desktop-based internet access to mobile services is taking e-government to the next level. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2023, Estonia unveiled a new smartphone app, mRiik, which will allow its citizens to access government services and hold digital versions of their ID card, passport, and other key documents. Parental benefits with the click of a button Estonia, a country widely regarded as a truly digital society, made yet another innovative leap at the end of 2019 by launching proactive family and parental benefits, moving toward a new proactive governance model. Read the case study Impact A unified digital access point that provides seamless, proactive services creates value for a wide range of stakeholders. Government State institutions benefit from: Improved efficiency The ability to integrate new services easily Improved quality of services and performance Actionable insights and dat Citizens and residents A system that’s straightforward, intuitive, and easy to use: Citizens and residents can quickly find exactly what they need A personalized service, based on each user’s unique circumstances Proactive offering of services and information based around life event journeys Seamless communication and interaction with different state institutions Business Digital services give businesses everything they need, in one place: Paperless, hassle-free business administration, from permits to taxes Accessible and efficient Proactive services, including reminders of important deadlines Support throughout business life cycle Visitors A unified portal can offer useful information for business and leisure travelers, and simplify entry and exit procedures: Real time information Support and advice before, during and after a trip Useful tourism, cultural and historical guides Investors Investors can find all the information they need, quickly and easily: Simplified guidance that takes an investor through business procedures and protocols Lower administrative barriers The future of government services The proliferation of data and rapid evolution of digital technology has created the perfect environment for governments worldwide to create truly efficient, proactive services for the public – so effectively and subtly that users don’t notice the process.

    "content": "Article October 20, 2024 by Bobby Chandan, Client Principal at Nortal It’s time to exploit the next generation of innovative public service solutions With rising demand, the cost-of-living crisis, and broader geopolitical instability, it’s clear we need to adopt new approaches to build trust in the government’s ability to use modern technology effectively. Service Data and AI Industry Government The doom loop of rising costs and stagnant productivity Many of us feel that our local public services are facing significant challenges. At the more trivial end, my street isn’t swept as often, and I’m now paying for garden waste collection for the first time. However, a much more serious issue is the lack of coordination between health and social care services, which I experienced last year. This almost led to my dad being critically neglected, had I not been there to join the dots between different agencies. As we approach the Autumn Budget and 2025 Spending Review, the pressure on public services has never been greater. Local authorities are grappling with severe financial strain, driven by inflation, wage pressures, and increasing demand for services. The financial sustainability of many councils is at risk, with some already reliant on exceptional financial support from Central Government. The “Place-Based Public Service Budgets” report published by New Local earlier this year highlighted issues like fragmented funding, short-term crisis management, and a lack of coordination between services. These problems make it tough for local authorities to deliver effective, long-term solutions for their communities. Next generation government is already here Three months ago, I joined Nortal, a strategic innovation and technology company with a 20-year track-record of digitally transforming public services. Nortal started life in Estonia, a country that reimagined public services for its citizens after re-independence in 1991. Estonia posed the question: How can technology be best used for the benefit of citizens while driving economic growth? They were bold, prioritising some key enablers of democracy: investing in education, promoting citizen trust and providing transparency. Advocating for digital inclusion across generations and hard to reach communities encouraged strong citizen engagement and adoption. Today, 99% of Estonia’s government services are online. Nortal has been instrumental in creating 40% of those. The next phase of Estonia’s development is what Nortal calls personal government . This approach, which you can read about via the link, moves the focus towards public services becoming more proactive, personalised, and sustainable, so that life events trigger automatic support or early intervention tailored around individual need. I’ve been thinking about how some of these ideas might help address the challenges here in the UK, especially in response to impending budget and spending reviews ahead. Case study How AI accelerates the legislative power of the Parliament of Estonia Joining the dots with technology and data One major issue in the UK is the fragmented nature of funding, where different services are funded separately, leading to inefficiencies. Personal government employs an integrated approach, where services are designed around the needs of the citizen rather than the structures of government. By pooling resources and focusing on outcomes that matter to people, we can create a more cohesive and effective public service system. In the UK, regional and place-based budgets are ideal testing grounds for this concept, and the following three areas could provide a good place to start: Proactive provision instead of short-term crisis management. Many government commentators talk of a “doom-loop” of short-term crisis management that prevents long-term planning. Personal government anticipates and addresses these needs before they become crises. This shift from reactive to proactive service delivery helps break the cycle of short-term fixes to enable long-term solutions. Designing services around the citizen to address a lack of coordination. Personal government creates a seamless experience by putting the citizen at the centre of service design. This means using technology so that all relevant services are interconnected, and citizens have a single point of access for all their needs. This approach can hide and join up the complexity of Government’s delivery organisation for the user. Empowerment and trust outweigh top-down efficiency. One size fits all initiatives often fail to produce real savings or improvements. By harnessing the capacity of a community to support its citizens, and better understanding of leading indicators to rising demand, we can better involve citizens in the design and delivery of services, the resulting system is not only more efficient, but it is more trusted and valued by the people it serves. As a starting point, personal government empowers citizens and builds trust through transparency and control over personal data. Are we ready for data driven innovation? The latest advances in AI highlight both the power and weakness of the underlying data it relies on. Once our data is properly prepared, we can harness algorithms and AI to enhance planning and decision-making, optimise service delivery, and improve public engagement. AI enables smarter planning by forecasting events and simulating decision impacts, ensuring that policies are effective and up to date. It automates routine tasks, manages service delivery more efficiently, and accurately predicts service demands. AI can also enhance public engagement by quickly analysing public sentiment or providing personalised responses, speeding up transactional enquiries while tailoring services to meet citizen and community needs. However, all these benefits depend on a solid foundation of data readiness. Data must be collected, cleansed, labelled, and integrated into a unified system. It must be secured to protect privacy and ensure compliance with regulations. Data must be handled ethically and without bias. In other words, data readiness builds trust both within an organisation and with external stakeholders. Case study Unemployment Insurance Fund prevents unemployment with Artificial Intelligence Practical steps at the local level For these innovative approaches to be successful, having the right data infrastructure and governance is crucial for ensuring that solutions are effective, non-biased, ethical, safe, compliant, and secure. These can be implemented at a regional or local level. Nortal have developed their thinking into the 5 steps below in collaboration with its previous clients: Invest in data infrastructure . Local authorities need to invest in their data infrastructure so it can handle large volumes of data from diverse sources. Modernise legacy systems and adopt cloud-based solutions for scalability and accessibility. Build advanced data analytics expertise . Utilising tools like generative AI significantly enhances data quality and provides deeper insights. These technologies automate data cleansing and labelling processes and ensure accuracy and timeliness of data used for decision-making. Foster a data-driven culture . Encourage all levels of the organisation to embrace data-driven decision-making. Training staff on data literacy and providing them with the tools and resources they need to analyse and interpret data. Apply data governance, compliance and ethics . As data becomes more integral to public services, safeguarding it against breaches and misuse is paramount. Implementing stringent data privacy policies and security measures will help build trust with citizens. Promote policies and protections that share data for public good. Governments can enhance data sharing while protecting privacy by adopting technologies like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation. These tools enable data analysis without revealing personal information. Easier said than done While those five steps may seem straightforward, they can be challenging to implement. The process becomes smoother with the guidance of experienced professionals. At Nortal, we collaborate with visionary public sector leaders worldwide to simplify government processes, build trust, and enhance services for citizens.

    "content": "Home Insights An Intelligent Search for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community Article February 9, 2024 An Intelligent Search for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community Service Data and AI Experience and Design Modern Software Development Seamless Experiences Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Nortal created an AI-based proof of concept to tackle operational challenges in the procurement process by offering solutions to specific pain points. The intelligent search, as part of the Nortal Tark solution, aims to answer sustainability-related queries and identify relevant documents in the procurement context. The primary goal is to showcase how AI can enhance decision-making in a political context, while promoting transparency in an eGovernment setting. The proof of concept was successfully delivered, meeting all customer requirements, and ensuring data sovereignty for the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community. Challenge The digitalization of procurement poses several challenges for the German public sector, including complex processes, tracking sustainability in procurements, and a significant documentation burden. The Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community produces hundreds of service descriptions for procurements each year, but the data within is largely untapped. This makes it difficult to evaluate procurement sustainability and use past procurements for strategic political decisions. Furthermore, it is crucial for procurers to have quick and easy access to existing information and documents to streamline their workflows efficiently. Addressing these issues is vital for enhancing transparency and efficiency in German public procurement. Solution The solution uses artificial intelligence to improve the creation of service descriptions in public procurement. Users are supported by the proof of concept AI text assistant, which uses an internal dataset of service descriptions and Sustainability documents and guidelines. The AI text assistant works in two stages. In the first stage, users ask questions and receive relevant text passages with a percentage indicating their similarity to the query. The second stage involves generating responses using the selected Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure accurate and contextual responses in natural language. The implemented solution “ Nortal Tark ” is generally LLM agnostic, meaning that any LLM can be used. The user interface design prioritises accessibility, user needs and confidence in AI answers. By emphasising task simplicity, the design streamlines complex processes. The minimalist interface minimises distractions and promotes a calm user experience. The solution is extensible to allow for flexible interactions, including multiple document formats and integration with platforms such as SharePoint or Confluence. It can operate in Q/A or chat mode, and the system highlights the exact snippet from which the answer is derived, ensuring transparency and accuracy. A second feature of the solution was to provide statistical information on the sustainability of a procurement. Sustainability notes contain critical sustainability information, but their accessibility is currently a challenge. These notes, completed during the procurement process, offer significant potential for comprehensive reporting and data-driven decisions in sustainable procurement. The sustainability statistics feature of Intelligent Search aims to make this data accessible and aggregated. The proof of concept provides initial analysis and visualisation for easy understanding and re-use. Result A reliable proof of concept was developed to meet the operational requirements of the Procurement Office, with a focus on data sovereignty. The AI-based solution utilises the power of a Large Language Model to address sustainability and efficiency issues in procurement. It provides optimisation and transparency by making relevant documents easily accessible, searchable, and reusable. The initiative aims to showcase the potential of AI in enhancing strategic decision-making in a policy context and promoting transparency in an eGovernment environment. Additionally, it aims to simplify the work of procurement officers by offering a practical and scalable solution. Contact us and find out how your organization can use AI efficiently and securely.

This transformation involves turning the traditional government view inside-out, prioritizing what citizens should experience – their data, contextual opportunities, and obligations – while minimizing everything else. Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Watch the recording of the discussion with industry experts Andres Raieste , Senior Vice President of the Public Sector at Nortal, Mihkel Solvak , Associate Professor at the University of Tartu, and Ville Sirviö , CEO of the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions, as they dive deep into the future of public services, emphasizing the critical role of trust in digital services and exploring the future of interoperability from a global and whole-of-society perspective. Personal government is a vision that considers the next stage of already developed digital societies to provide more human-centric public services, considering the complexities where traditional digital government approaches do not necessarily provide a straightforward solution. Revolutionizing government: Turning the traditional view inside-out For the past several decades, the gradual adoption of new technologies in society and the digitalization of public services have allowed many nations to increase the efficiency and approval of public services. However, the maturity and impact of digitalization vastly differ based on the extent to which society has adopted new technologies and services in everyday life . The most significant differentiator in various maturity levels is how society has established trust in digital services and fostered high cooperation between authorities and citizens to build a robust data-based society and governance. In societies where the fundamentals of digital governance have been reasonably resolved, new types of services that cut across governance domains begin to emerge. Typically, these services do not have direct traditional analogs. The full realization of the possibilities of public services in the era of personal government requires the adoption of emerging technologies and the reorganization of the government’s working principles in terms of service provision and cooperation between institutions. Achieving high cooperation, enabled by interoperability and a whole-of-society approach to service delivery, is essential . All these capabilities are either well within today’s technological development or within reach and can be realized in the foreseeable future.

    "content": "Home Insights Research: Trust lacking in digital public services Article July 4, 2024 Research: Trust lacking in digital public services Thanks to consumer expectations driven by a world of one-click commerce, governments will eventually be required to embrace digital technologies in public services. There are of course obstacles to doing so, but they are not technology—the main barrier is trust. Read the report Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Industry Government Government Transformation In brief Thanks to private-sector products and services offered by companies like Uber, DoorDash, Netflix, Amazon, and others, consumers have come to rely on and trust digital-only interactions with product- and service providers. Working with Censuswide, the London-based market research consultancy, 4,000 subjects in the UK and Canada were polled concerning their future expectations for digitally-based government services, the digital perception gap between private- and public-sector capabilities, as well as the amount of time they currently spend engaged getting government services. Respondents made it clear that they spend too much time obtaining healthcare, registering a car, or paying taxes. And they do expect governments to one day soon embrace digital technology in these public services. This finding was not surprising. However, the barriers identified were. While all respondents knew that technology offers a solution, few felt government could be trusted to offer it. Private companies, they felt, were more trustworthy. Read the report Since we live in a world where many interactions are only a click away, we wondered how people feel about the level of digitalization we are accustomed to from Uber or Amazon applied to healthcare, registering a car, or paying taxes. For the purposes of this research, digitalization was defined as never having to visit a physical office, with services are personalized to your needs and available to you when you need it with just a click of a button. Citizens expect government to go digital within two years Two in three citizens of the UK (66%) want to see the government deliver a fully digital suite of online public services, with an overwhelming majority (85%) wanting this shift to occur within the next two years. The vast majority of (70%) Canadians want fully digital public services, and 87% expect this within the next two years. But while the expectations are present, trust is not: Two thirds (66%) of UK citizens polled want fully online public digital services, but one-third (31%) do not trust the government to deliver them. Almost one-third of UK respondents (30%) said they are more likely to share personal data with private sector companies than the government for personalized services. 48% of all Canadians cite security and privacy concerns as their biggest fear in the shift to digital public services. Citizens want fully-digitized public services soon 85% of UK respondents want fully-digitalized public services within the next two years. 70% of Canadians demand fully digital public services, and 87% expect this by 2026. Problems currently take too long to resolve 29% of UK respondents believe issues take too long to resolve. UK respondents reported they spent on average a total of 12 hours engaging with government public services in the last year. The average Canadian spent 28 hours engaging with government services in the last year. Younger generations are more critical Generation Z (born 1997-2012) and Millennials are most critical of government services and need for more modern tech. In Canada, younger generations are most critical of government service, with 16% of Generation Z finding room for improvement. Citizens skeptical of government’s ability to deliver While 66% of Brits want fully-online public digital services, a full third (31%) are not convinced government can deliver. When it comes to personalized services, 30% of UK respondents say they are more likely to share personal data with private sector companies than the government. 48% of Canadian respondents cite security and privacy concerns as their biggest fear in the shift to digital public services. UK citizens and Canadians report being 10 times more likely to give their data in exchange for a Netflix recommendation, than for better benefits in a public service. Bridging the trust gap Nortal has been a part of building the most trusted governments in the world, we commissioned this study to better understand the environments in which we work. In an environment with many age groups and their differing expectations, we wanted to gain insight into how our customers can cater to the needs of the aging population while planning and creating services of the future. It is clear that governments have a mandate to offer public services in a digital format. But this study makes it clear that technology is not enough. The trust gap must be bridged at the same time. Nortal works with governments to make digital services accessible , meaning we guide the user toward digital channels, enabling them to get important tasks done through the channel they prefer.

    "title": "Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet",
    "content": "Home Insights Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet Article March 19, 2024 by Kertti Merimaa, VP of Healthcare (Estonia) Personalized medicine: Where technology and genomic data meet Personalized medicine is nothing new. Medical services have been enhanced by genomic testing since the end of the last century, but these services have been mostly regarded as exclusive or niche. But all of that is changing. Service Strategy and Transformation Industry Healthcare Nortal, together with partners in Estonia, has revolutionized the way we think of personalized medicine, creating a fully-operating infrastructure for Estonia, making it the first country ever to provide public, widely-scaled, genetic-powered medical services to its residents. A paradigm shift in healthcare Personalized medicine has brought an extra layer of precision and personalization to the medical care for many years, but has yet to be deployed in a wider scale. Imagine a healthcare system where every clinical pathway, treatment, every prescription is tailored to the unique genetic makeup of an individual. This is the promise of personalized medicine, a paradigm shift that has the potential to transform the way we approach healthcare on a global scale. At the forefront of this innovation is Estonia, a nation pioneering a new era in healthcare delivery through the integration of genomic data and cutting-edge technology. In Estonia, this vision is fast becoming a reality. In 2023, working with a host of partners, Nortal finished laying the foundations to provide large-scale, personalized medicine to Estonian residents. Thanks to new, pioneering healthcare policies and an empowering IT infrastructure, genetic information was connected harmoniously and safely to the healthcare ecosystem, enabling the seamless use of genomic powered algorithms in both prevention programs and everyday healthcare, such as the prescription of medication. Estonian Genome Centre is being entrusted with one of the highest coverage of genome data of population, implying that the people have the trust in nation to create health services that are truly precise and personalized. Genetics in everyday care The journey towards personalized medicine in Estonia is characterized by a forward-thinking approach to healthcare infrastructure. The creation of a nationwide IT framework, which is service-legislation agnostic, provides a robust platform for the delivery of a wide range of personalized medical services and an excellent testing ground for the development of new computing models. This ecosystem seamlessly connects biobanks, healthcare providers, national health records, and genetic algorithm computation services to automate the use of genetic algorithms in everyday care. An opt-in system by design, Estonians may easily manage consent to include their genetic data in the ecosystem, as well as order available genetic testing on the national patient portal. Alongside other personal health data, they may also manage genetic test results on the portal, and, if needed, book consultations with physicians. If citizens data is not yet included in the national biobank, they may do so by booking appointments at selected laboratories. Estonia’s computational environment for personalized medicine provides a unique platform to automate the calculation of a variety of genetic risks. Since the environment is safely connected to biobanks and the national heath record, algorithms run in the environment can use a wide array of health and environmental data, such as radiological imaging, diagnoses, and even lifestyle facts. The monitoring and management platform for genetic risk models offers a transparent overview and management of the growing number algorithms included to the platform, providing insights for algorithm creators for product improvement. Also, on this platform the results of the calculations are exported to the healthcare documentation form and sent to National Health Record. From there on, the documents are usable by healthcare providers and decision support systems. The personalized medicine management platform acts as the heart of the ecosystem. Hosted in the National Health Record, it helps keep track of consent, availability of data needed for calculations, and the status of each calculation, even automatically triggering an order for a calculation, if needed by a connected e-service. Doctors may order and see results of genetic tests through their local clinical systems, since rapid data exchange between health care provider systems and the national health record provides opportunity to seamlessly integrate the use of genetic algorithms in to clinical processes, minimizing extra steps. Results are also available on the national healthcare record’s doctors’ dashboard (also known as Data Viewer), a separate national information service for clinical doctors, to give optimal access to a patient’s health data in a user-friendly visual form. This sounds almost too good to be true, but Estonia has invested 20 years in interconnecting healthcare, using national technological building blocks such as the X-road for data exchange and ID numbers for unique patient identification. Since much of the groundwork was already present, it was easier to deploy new genetic-based functionalities in the ecosystem. Battling breast cancer and depression The first two services introduced in Estonia are a testament to the transformative potential of personalized medicine. A breast cancer screening program allows women to order genetic testing to assess their risk of developing breast cancer. If a risk is identified, individuals are included in the national screening program at a younger age, facilitating early detection and timely intervention. Similarly, the decision support system for prescribing antidepressants is poised to revolutionize mental healthcare in Estonia. By leveraging pharmacogenomic testing, doctors can make more informed decisions when prescribing antidepressants, leading to improved treatment outcomes and potentially life-saving interventions. Personalized medicine’s staggering potential The smart implementation of personalized medicine on a large scale can have a significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide. In an environment of soaring healthcare costs and a growing deficit of healthcare specialists, personalized medicine can help bring costs under control with better targeted care and a push for preventative care. Take, for example, the staggering healthcare costs associated with depression. The economic burden of major depressive disorder among U.S. adults only has been estimated to be in hundreds of billions, from treatment costs to indirect costs to the society, caused by the sufferer’s inability to work and function in everyday life. Costs may be reduced by improving the effectiveness of treatment, thus increasing the number of patients who achieve remission. Antidepressants are the first line of treatment, though more than half of patients do not respond to treatment on the first try, and even fewer achieve remission. This results in trial-and-error regimens that lead to treatment failures and side effects of medication. By using pharmacogenetic testing, it is estimated that, in Estonia, the gains are for each life-year gained amount to 30,000 to 50,000 euros saved on healthcare costs. Prescribing an effective medicine on the first try produces results on many levels. In addition to better targeted care, personalized medicine offers opportunities for prevention and early detection. Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in Estonian women. According to current statistics, every 14th woman will get breast cancer during her lifetime. Each year, approximately 800 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, with 38 percent suffering from a spread to lymph nodes or neighboring organs at the time of detection, and 10 percent with a tumor with distant metastases — that is, a poor prognosis due to spread. If the cancer can be detected earlier, the prognosis would be much better. For women under 40 (around 20 percent of cases), it is believed that cancer traced to monogenic predisposition is more prevalent, thus it may be concluded that genome-based screening may prove useful for early detection. The value proposition of personalized medicine lies in its ability to deliver the right help to people at the right time. Whether with the treatment of cancer, depression, heart disease, or any other number of conditions, personalized medicine offers a targeted approach to healthcare that can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Policy is a precondition Despite its obvious benefits, the journey towards personalized medicine is not without its challenges. The healthcare domain is exceptionally sensitive and sophisticated, and the implementation of personalized medical services means careful navigation, as well as legislative- and policy decisions. Nortal believes that carefully developed service models and clear regulation, accompanied by technology as an enabler, permit big things to happen. In the case of implementing personalized medicine in Estonia, Nortal participated in the entire process, from the business analysis of service models to the technical development of IT infrastructure. This participation in the full service creation lifecycle ensures that agreements and technology go hand in hand, enabling one another, instead of holding the other back. Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery, offering tailored solutions that promise to revolutionize patient care. Estonia’s pioneering efforts serve as a blueprint for nations around the world, demonstrating the transformative potential of integrating genomics and technology into healthcare delivery. As we look toward the future, personalized medicine offers a glimpse of a world where healthcare can be truly precise and personalized.

    "content": "Home Insights Moving healthcare to the cloud Case study March 7, 2024 Moving healthcare to the cloud Service Cloud Transformation Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Healthcare Nortal built a Microsoft Azure cloud environment for Finland’s Kanta-Häme county that allows multiple IT vendors to develop services independently with shared underlying infrastructure and governance. Orders from above In 2021, Finland’s government passed social and healthcare reform legislation making the organization of health, social, and emergency services the responsibility of 21 “Wellbeing” counties in Finland. The reform was designed to ensure equality of service to end users while controlling cost growth. Kanta-Häme county in Southern Finland was designated one of these Wellbeing counties, requiring it to take control of services previously offered by 11 different municipalities. “This was the largest reform in recent memory in Finland,” says Jarkko Enden , CTO at Nortal Finland. “The work force was moved from city- to county level, and an entirely new organization was created. The reform created enormous pressure, since the counties now had to do more with less money.” – Harri Halinen, Development Manager, IT, Kanta-Häme well-being county As we embark on harnessing cloud technologies in our well-being county, our collaboration with Nortal and their experts has proven exceptionally pleasant and fruitful. An atmosphere of trust To do more with less required a modern, cloud-based solution, though that in no way was as simple as it may sound. The default “lift and shift” approach moves legacy systems to the cloud as they are, but there are several problems with this. “Some think lift and shift will introduce cost savings, but many find out there aren’t automatic benefits,” says Enden. “It can even cost you more if you don’t do it properly.” A second issue was that the platform needed to allow new applications to be built by a variety of independent vendors who would employ cutting-edge technology for new services, slowly allowing the strangulation of legacy systems. For example, legacy systems like finance, HR, and patient record systems will eventually be moved to the cloud, yet the platform also needs to allow for modernization like enabling video calls with customers, and the history of patient data stored in different systems needs to be easily accessible by customer support personnel. The project’s second phase established a centralized API management solution within the newly created environment, allowing for data to be published and stored in a controlled and secure manner via APIs. The APIs can be made accessible within the internal environment or even from the public internet – connecting on-premise systems to the cloud. For example, the Oma-Häme app, Kanta-Häme’s on-demand doctor service, leverages the new API layer to connect existing services and data sources directly to the application. This allows development to focus on building for the end-user, by ensuring the backend architecture is done right. Kanta-Häme turned to Nortal to build this most important part of its cloud transformation journey. Nortal had Anssi Pannula and Tuomo Hokkanen , two Cloud Architects with long Microsoft histories and Azure certifications. Although Nortal has many Microsoft experts, they also have a reputation for being cloud agnostic. “We’re often more in the role of consultants,” says Enden. – Jarkko Enden, CTO at Nortal Finland We use Google and Amazon, as well, but since we don't sell our own products, we're known for not trying to sell licenses and things customers don’t need or won’t use. That allows us to build real trust with our clients. Constant innovation While their cloud environment and its governance models will constantly evolve, the benefits are already apparent. The shared underlying infrastructure allows for the construction of innovative features by dozens of vendors, in a matter of hours instead of weeks. Security is ensured, privacy guaranteed, and performance enhanced without adding costs. It is far from complete — and, by design, never will be. “Pace-layered architecture recognizes that different parts of an organization’s IT landscape change at different rates,” says Enden. “The system we created is a place where Kanta-Häme will build and build and keep on building. It allows for constant innovation.” – Harri Halinen, Development Manager, IT, Kanta-Häme well-being county The true value of expertise shines through, especially in tackling intricate technological challenges. A seasoned expert often finds solutions effortlessly, quickly and in cost effective way.

    "content": "Case study August 28, 2023 A hospital information system for smoother workflows and better care Service Data and AI Seamless Experiences Industry Healthcare Nortal is building a Hospital Information System (HIS) with the objective to improve workflows for doctors and nurses, and therefore help them deliver better care to patients. This case study is based on the HIS implementation within Tartu University Hospital and all its subsidiaries in southern Estonia and Viljandi hospital. Challenge With health data becoming increasingly digitized, doctors are spending more time entering data on their computers and less time interacting with patients. The software systems adopted by hospitals are often clunky, with staff becoming increasingly frustrated and reluctant towards embracing new sets of fragmented technologies. Solution: Smooth communication between all health systems We created The Hospital Information System to cover all processes within the hospital, while also enabling smooth communication with other information systems is Healthcare (such as the National Health Record). HIS makes sure that the patient’s journey is thoroughly recorded from the moment they contact the hospital to book a visit to the moment a bill is received after being discharged. Within the hospital, a central process-driven solution unifies and simplifies the complex diagnostic and healthcare processes for staff in order to help them provide patients with high-quality medical services even more effectively. Impact: Delivering better care to patients The Hospital Information System has significantly reduced the administrative workload of hospital staff, enabling the clinical personnel to focus more on the actual diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly – the patient. The Patient Portal allows patients to access their medical data more conveniently while giving them the ability to engage with the medical process transparently from the get-go.

    "content": "Home Insights 2025: The year cybersecurity rules rewrite U.S. healthcare Article January 6, 2025 by Liz Kiehner, Chief Growth Officer of North America, Nortal 2025: The year cybersecurity rules rewrite U.S. healthcare The U.S. healthcare industry is entering 2025 under the spotlight of heightened cybersecurity threats and evolving regulatory landscapes. In response to the growing number of cyberattacks targeting sensitive patient data and critical infrastructure, new cybersecurity regulations are being introduced at both federal and state levels. These measures aim to enhance the resilience of healthcare organizations and protect patient privacy. Service Cyber Resilience Industry Healthcare Industry Key regulatory changes impacting the healthcare sector in 2025 1. Health Infrastructure Security and Accountability Act (HISAA) Proposed by Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Warner, HISAA introduces minimum cybersecurity standards for healthcare organizations, including hospitals and health plans. Key requirements: annual security audits, improved threat detection, and enhanced technical safeguards. Federal funding will help smaller providers meet these standards. Currently under Senate review, HISAA could be enacted by 2025. 2. New York State Department of Health Cybersecurity Regulations Starting January 1, 2025, New York hospitals must implement comprehensive cybersecurity programs, conduct regular risk assessments, and promptly report incidents. These measures aim to protect patient data and maintain healthcare services during cyberattacks. Non-compliance could lead to penalties and reputational harm. 3. California Assembly Bill 749 Effective 2025, AB 749 mandates a zero-trust architecture for healthcare, emphasizing micro-segmentation for medical devices and clinical networks. Quarterly assessments will ensure effectiveness and prevent attackers from exploiting weak links. This law addresses the rising vulnerabilities of interconnected medical systems. 4. Updates to the HIPAA Security Rule The updated HIPAA Security Rule requires network segmentation to prevent unauthorized lateral movement in systems with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). These enhancements target modern threats like ransomware and advanced persistent threats, ensuring healthcare organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber risks. Implications for healthcare organizations To comply with these new regulations, healthcare organizations must: Establish a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Program: Ensure policies, procedures, and governance structures align with evolving regulations, providing a solid foundation for all security efforts. Conduct Ongoing Risk Assessments: Regularly evaluate vulnerabilities, threats, and potential compliance gaps. Use these assessments to continuously refine a cybersecurity program. Implement a Zero-Trust Architecture: Incorporate elements such as micro-segmentation, network segmentation for ePHI, and continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorized lateral movement and strengthen overall network defenses. Build a Cyber-Aware Workforce: Provide robust training and education programs that equip employees with the knowledge to recognize threats, follow best practices, and effectively utilize security tools. While these regulations introduce new compliance responsibilities and operational burdens, they also present a critical opportunity to enhance overall resilience and strengthen trust in healthcare delivery. By going beyond mere box-ticking exercises and investing in meaningful improvements—such as advanced threat detection, zero-trust architectures, and robust employee training — organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to cyber risks. Conversely, viewing these new rules solely as compliance hurdles risks leaving valuable security potential on the table, ultimately increasing vulnerability and undermining patient confidence. In other words, embracing these regulations not just as mandates, but as a catalyst for long-term cybersecurity maturity, can pay dividends in both patient trust and organizational stability.

    "content": "Case study June 22, 2023 Space resource management in active use in Satakunta Optimizing the number of rooms in hospital facilities is a complex challenge, trying to solve issues like what kind of reception room a surgical procedure needs or the optimal space for a psychiatric admission. In its complexity, optimizing admission spaces in well-being services counties is perhaps one of the biggest challenges of the public sector’s facility management. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Healthcare Together with our customer 2M-IT, we have developed an agile solution for booking and optimizing hospital reception rooms called the Space Resource Management solution. Developed on Microsoft’s low-code Power Platform, this solution enables public administrations and services to efficiently manage and optimize the use of facilities. Challenge It is common for public administrations and services to be full of inefficient processes, routines, and manual steps that slow down customer and patient service and frustrate the already overburdened staff. For example, in older hospitals in well-being services counties, the average occupancy rate of outpatient clinic rooms is as low as 20%. In practice, an admission room can be empty up to four out of five working days a week. If the occupancy rate was closer to the target of 70%, the well-being services counties could invest the money they save on rent, heating, lighting, and building maintenance in patient care instead. Background The main objective of developing this solution was to ensure that even though professionals no longer have their own offices, there’s always a space available for all professionals and each appointment. Background work At the beginning of the project, the cornerstones of the customer’s operations were defined: what kind of services are being provided; how many rooms are available for use, e.g., in the entire hospital or in one of its outpatient clinics; the total number of professionals working on the premises; and which space is suitable for which service. In addition to the basic parameters, a myriad of different customer-specific rules can be defined for the solution. For example, we defined a “two-and-a-half-hour rule,” which means that if a professional has at least two appointments during a 2.5-hour period, these appointments will occur in the same room. This means that the professional does not have to leave the room between appointments, provided the available space is suitable for both appointments. The application’s optimization algorithm was developed in collaboration with the customer. The customer decided on the prioritization order of the requirements, and we translated the requirements into technology. For example, it can take into account that the busiest doctors with consecutive appointments should be able to stay in the same room for as long as possible. Professionals with more sporadic appointments can move from one room to another between their appointments – but even in these cases, it is prioritized, e.g., that these rooms are located on the same floor. This is all based on the requirements of the appointments, e.g., in terms of equipment needed for a procedure. Solution In hospitals, outpatient appointments are usually booked well in advance. The now-developed space resource management solution optimizes reservations for available rooms only the day before the appointment. This ensures that each appointment is allocated the most suitable space, considering the different requirements of the various reception services, thus ensuring efficient use of space and minimizing last-minute changes. We developed the solution piece-by-piece from small parts and used agile software development methodologies. We wanted to change the end users’ and our customers’ roles from buyers to active developers by involving from the beginning in design and development from the beginning. Cloud technology at the base of the application ensures that development is modern and scalable. – Anssi Luoma, Project Director of the Satasairaala Hospital Renewal project Without the pilot, such a space resource management solution for a hospital environment could not be developed and deployed, and the collaboration with 2M-IT and Nortal has been very close. Impact The newly developed space resource management solution will benefit any well-being services county that wants to improve the efficiency of its facilities. For example, in Satakunta, a new hospital building was commissioned in 2023, where professionals no longer have their own offices; instead, the space resource management solution has been implemented. The scale of economic savings that this change will achieve is illustrated by the fact that if all professionals still had their own offices, the new hospital building would have to be three times bigger than it is now. The key benefits of this solution include not only the automatic optimization of space and transparency of room reservations but also the ability to start forecasting and optimizing space for the future. As the system accumulates historical data on the service demands, future needs can be anticipated.

    "title": "Estonian Air Force utilizes AI to enhance Air Raid Warning System",
    "content": "Home Insights Estonian Air Force utilizes AI to enhance Air Raid Warning System Case study August 29, 2024 Estonian Air Force utilizes AI to enhance Air Raid Warning System The Estonian Air Force is a service branch of the Estonian Defense Forces. Since its re-establishment in 1994, the Estonian Air Force has been built up from scratch by a generation of relatively young airmen who embrace constant change and technological advances. The Estonian Air Force is designed to cooperate with NATO Air Forces and is optimistic about the future, which will bring a steady increase in operational capabilities across all fields of development. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Challenge Amid some uncertainty in regional geopolitical conditions the Estonian Air Force, inspired by the Ukraine counterparts, has started its own programs for developing AI-assisted solutions involving Estonia-based IT companies to develop the solutions. One of the recently revealed features of this program is implementing an AI-powered air threat identification system within the “Be Ready” mobile application – an Estonian Defense League’s application for increasing general population’s resilience by providing instructions for various crisis management situations etc. The recently developed AI assisted air threat detection solution integrated into this app enhances the national Air Raid Warning system by incorporating inputs from mobile phones of the participating citizens. The primary objective of this AI solution is to enhance the Estonian Air Force’s air threat detection capabilities, specifically on lower altitudes by incorporating citizen generated mobile phone-based reporting. This function in the app allows users to report air threats or suspicious air activities using their mobile phones, enabling the Air Force to receive actionable intelligence on air activities quickly and efficiently. Solution The AI-powered aircraft identification feature integrated into the app combines mobile phone technology with AI capabilities. Mobile application “Be Ready” enabled citizens quickly and easily capture photos of suspicious activities in the airspace and forward them to a server for further analysis by AI, followed by display in an Air Forces Air Operations Center. The debut of this capability was successfully tested during the Estonian largest annual joint military exercise – Spring Storm 2024. AI solution: AI processes the input, merging information from multiple users across a wider geographical area to compile a concise real-time report for the Air Force. This automated assessment includes among others the location of the report and the current and projected location of the reported object. In addition to real-time data and future projection, historical data can also be viewed for aiding in military decision-making. Results Usability and user experience Users can quickly open the app, point their phones at suspicious objects in the air and take a photo, submit their report, which includes the photo and additional information, through the AI server to the Air Force with a single tap. The app provides feedback to users, acknowledging the receipt of their report and thanking them for their valuable contribution. Operational impact and security The AI-enhanced “Be Ready” app significantly bolsters National security by enabling citizens to report any suspicious air activity in their vicinity. In emergency situations, the Air Force benefits from having additional “eyes” across the country, supported by AI that interprets objects type, locations, and other crucial information. Launch and implementation The AI solution for the app was launched during Estonia’s Defense Forces Spring Storm exercise on May 10, 2024. This military exercise served as a large-scale testbed for the implementation phase, where the app and its integrated AI features were stress-tested and thoroughly evaluated for effectiveness. Population engagement By involving the community, the Estonian Air Force enhances its air surveillance capabilities, promotes a sense of shared responsibility and vigilance among the populace. Actively engaged civilians add an extra layer to the security carpet and can become a crucial source of information in case of (however unlikely) conflict escalation. Possible next steps The AI-powered aircraft identification feature Keep integrating more sensors into the system to maintain and even enhance air surveillance capabilities at the lower altitudes. This is especially useful if military radars are on the move or otherwise temporarily unavailable. Create multiple layers of AI-processed information for different command levels and play with combining different data feeds and data points into a Combined Operating Picture. Add sound and image recognition to ensure automatic identification of aircraft and drones even at night or in case of poor weather conditions. – Estonian Air Force Exceptionally smooth cooperation with Nortal engineers ensured a rapid Nation-wide launch of the well-functioning prototype. Having eyes on the ground as well as in the air is a standard in a state-on-state military confrontation but poses a threat of soldiers becoming overwhelmed by inflow of information. As we incorporate AI for information processing we will gain more time for the commander’s decision making and that already is a tangible advantage. Conclusion The AI-powered air threat identification solution is a demonstration of the Estonia’s receptiveness to innovation. By creating a platform for citizen engagement and utilizing AI to process and relay information, the Estonian Air Force has significantly strengthened its ability to monitor and respond to threats in our airspace. This initiative promptly highlights the potential of AI-driven solutions in enhancing security and promoting community involvement in the National defense framework. The Estonian Defense Forces goal is to enhance the overall resilience of Estonia’s residents and enable the Air Force to create a comprehensive air picture that includes civilian reporting integrated with the more traditional radar picture. Merging these two into one seamless feed.

    "title": "Ensuring operational continuity through resilient swarming",
    "content": "Article April 15, 2025 by Ivo Pure, Lead Architect at Nortal Ensuring operational continuity through resilient swarming Service Cyber Force Protection Technology and Engineering Industry Defence Cyber Resilience Swarming Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UASs) are revolutionizing military operations. Unlike traditional autonomous units that act independently, these advanced systems—ranging from aerial drones to unmanned ground and maritime vehicles—operate as a highly coordinated, self-organising network. By leveraging decentralised communication, real-time situational awareness, and human-out-of-the-loop decision-making, swarming UASs can execute missions with unparalleled speed, adaptability, and efficiency across air, land, sea, and cyber domains. However, as these systems become more autonomous, ensuring cybersecurity and resilience against adversarial threats and system vulnerabilities is more critical than ever. Advanced security solutions are essential to safeguard these networks and mitigate vulnerabilities. Key components of swarm operations The effectiveness of swarming UASs depends on the seamless integration of communication systems and autonomy modules that enable continuous, real-time collaboration. Communication systems establish a secure data exchange framework, allowing units to share intelligence, mission updates, and adaptive operational strategies. These systems must function even under electronic warfare threats, such as jamming and interference. Autonomy modules use situational-based AI and machine learning to drive independent decision-making, enhance situational awareness, and enable self-organisation in complex and unpredictable mission environments. Each unit is also equipped with Distributed detection systems , which enable localized threat monitoring and autonomous countermeasures. This reduces reliance on centralised command structures, enhancing operational flexibility. Centralised coordination mechanisms , meanwhile, provide a Global View of Operations during mission execution. This allows human operators to oversee swarm dynamics, issue high-level directives, and intervene as necessary. In environments where GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) dependency presents a critical vulnerability, multi-layered navigation systems offer redundancy. These systems combine onboard sensor fusion, terrain-based navigation, and adaptive localisation techniques to ensure continued operational effectiveness. Cyber security challenges Despite their operational advantages, swarming UAS face a range of cybersecurity and operational challenges that threaten mission effectiveness. Vulnerabilities to Electronic Warfare (EW) Attacks. The reliance on real-time communication introduces weaknesses to RF jamming, signal interception, and GNSS spoofing, which adversaries can use to disrupt coordination and misdirect units. Expanded Attack Surface. Due to the distributed nature of swarm architectures, the overall attack surface grows significantly. A single compromised unit can serve as a point of entry, allowing adversaries to infiltrate or degrade the entire swarm. Challenges to Autonomous Decision-Making. Autonomous decision-making in adversarial environments complicates resilience efforts. AI-driven autonomy is vulnerable to data poisoning, adversarial manipulation, and sensor-based deception, leading to suboptimal mission execution or potential system failure. Need for Robust Data Validation and Integrity. Multi-agent systems require finely tuned data validation and integrity mechanisms to prevent erroneous information from spreading throughout the swarm, which could compromise collective decision-making processes. Addressing these challenges requires an advanced cybersecurity framework integrating adaptive threat detection, self-healing response mechanisms, and secure swarm-wide coordination protocols to ensure operational continuity in highly contested battlespaces. Article Unmanned ground systems are the backbone of modern defence Building resilience in next-generation swarming Ensuring resilience in next-generation swarming UAS operations requires a combination of autonomous adaptation, robust communication, and intelligent navigation. A resilient swarm must be capable of maintaining operational effectiveness under cyber threats, electronic warfare (EW) disruptions, and environmental challenges. Autonomous Adaptation & Threat Mitigation Adaptive Monitoring Systems: Continuous monitoring of UAS behavior is achieved through distributed anomaly detection mechanisms. These systems assess deviations in communication integrity, movement path consistency, and sensor data accuracy by cross-referencing inputs from multiple swarm units. This redundancy-based validation ensures that anomalies such as spoofing attempts, navigation drift, or sensor degradation are identified before they compromise mission effectiveness. Detected irregularities trigger automated mitigation protocols, including autonomous recalibration of affected subsystems or dynamic reallocation of mission roles to unaffected units. Self-Healing Mechanisms: Autonomous self-recovery protocols enable units to reconfigure formations, redistribute tasks, and restore network integrity in response to compromised or lost nodes. Secure Communication & Coordination Decentralised Consensus Protocols: Swarm units employ distributed trust mechanisms to validate mission-critical data and ensure resilience against cyber manipulation. Encrypted, Redundant Data Channels: Multi-layered encryption and frequency-hopping communication mitigate EW attacks, jamming, and signal interception. Mission-Aware Coordination: AI-enhanced mission control dynamically issues high-level directives while swarm units execute decentralised decision-making, ensuring operational flexibility. Multi-Layered Navigation & GNSS Independence Sensor Fusion & Terrain-Based Navigation: Integrating LIDAR, computer vision, and inertial navigation systems (INS) allows the swarm to maneuver effectively in GPS-denied environments. Cognitive Environmental Mapping: Real-time environmental learning enables the swarm to detect, classify, and adapt to dynamic obstacles and adversarial conditions. Together, these solutions reinforce the swarm’s self-sufficiency, adaptability, and security, ensuring continued effectiveness in highly adversarial conditions. Advancing secure autonomous swarming We at Nortal Defence have developed a comprehensive, modular solution to enhance the resilience of swarming UASs in contested environments. By integrating adaptive monitoring, autonomous threat mitigation, and AI-driven intelligence, we ensure that these systems can operate securely, even in complex, high-risk operational theatres. With dynamic threat monitoring, self-recovery capabilities, and secure communication, we help swarming UASs maintain mission integrity under cyber threats. The balance between directive-based centralised oversight and decentralised autonomy ensures scalability, agility, and long-term survivability, allowing these systems to self-adapt, neutralise emerging threats, and operate confidently in rapidly evolving mission environments. As autonomous warfare evolves, securing swarming UAS operations remains critical. Our expertise in resilient multi-agent autonomy, cyber defence, and mission-critical AI systems underpins the foundation for next-generation distributed warfare, enabling military forces to deploy secure, adaptable, and highly effective swarming UASs in the face of modern threats.

    "content": "Article May 23, 2025 by Peter Leinberg, Head of Exercise Planning and Delivery Cyber resilience in action: Why cyber exercising is the key to surviving digital threats Explore different exercises Service Cyber Resilience Industry Energy and Resources Strategy and Transformation Despite increasing investments in security tools, many organisations still struggle with cyber resilience. Why? Because technology alone cannot solve the problem – people are often the weakest link , and without proper preparation, even the most advanced defences can crumble. This coin has two sides; however – cyber exercises transform the weakest link into cybersecurity’s most valuable asset. The urgency of cyber resilience Cyber threats are escalating at an alarming rate. In 2023 alone, global cybercrime costs reached €7 trillion , with forecasts predicting a rise to over € 9 trillion in 2025 . Ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and supply chain attacks have become daily occurrences, targeting businesses, governments, and critical infrastructure alike. Organisations must recognise that cyber threats are not just an IT problem – they are an existential risk that can disable operations, damage reputations, and result in severe financial losses. As a result of a ransomware attack in April 2025, the British retailer Marks & Spencer lost about £ 60M ( €71M) in revenue due to having to suspend online sales, its stock price fell more than 15%, wiping billions off its market capitalisation, and customer loyalty dwindled after learning that some customer data was also stolen during the attack. Healthcare institutions have seen ransomware attacks delay life-saving procedures; manufacturing plants have suffered production halts due to operational technology (OT) breaches, and financial institutions have faced crippling fraud incidents. The infamous 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack , which led to widespread fuel shortages across the U.S., is a stark reminder of how cyber incidents can disrupt entire economies. In this high-stakes landscape, cyber resilience is no longer optional – it’s a necessity . Resilience means being able to anticipate, withstand, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents with minimal disruption. It ensures that businesses can continue to operate despite attacks, mitigating damage and maintaining stakeholder trust. To achieve cyber resilience, organisations must create an ecosystem that integrates continuous employee training and realistic cyber exercises, along with clear governance, proactive risk management, and robust cybersecurity tools. This approach builds preparedness, ensures swift incident response, and maintains operational stability even in the face of sophisticated threats. Explore different exercises The human factor: The Achilles’ heel of cybersecurity Studies show that 82% of cyber breaches involve human error . Whether it’s an employee falling for a phishing email, using weak passwords, or misconfiguring cloud storage, the human element remains a top security vulnerability. Organisations invest billions in cybersecurity yet often overlook the simplest defence mechanism: education and preparedness. There is a reason why a British Army adage dating back to World War II is still used and relevant, highlighting the importance of training before action. The 7Ps – Prior Planning and Preparation Prevent Piss Poor Performance. Beyond unintentional mistakes, social engineering attacks exploit human psychology , making even the most security-aware individuals susceptible to manipulation. Recently, Microsoft’s Regional Director, security researcher, and consultant, Troy Hunt, shared how he fell for a phishing attack . Attackers exploit trust, urgency, and authority to deceive employees into handing over credentials, transferring funds, or granting access to sensitive systems. One of the most common forms of social engineering, phishing messages have skyrocketed by 4,151% since the advent of ChatGPT in 2022. The consequences of human error are costly. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report , businesses lose an average of €3.9 million per breach , with phishing and stolen credentials being the top initial attack vectors. Furthermore, 60% of small and medium-sized businesses go out of business within six months of experiencing a cyberattack. But here’s the paradox – while human error is the cause of most cyber incidents, humans are also the solution. A well-trained workforce can act as a human firewall, detecting anomalies, responding to threats efficiently, and preventing incidents before they escalate. Employees may be the weakest link, but they are also the first line of defence and, potentially, when educated, our greatest cyber defence asset. Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue – it’s a cultural one. A strong security culture ensures that cyber awareness becomes second nature, integral to everyday operations. A strong security culture also relies on another cultural choice, one that values and champions continuous education. When coupled with leadership buy-in and reinforced through realistic cyber exercises, these aspects of a mature, agile organisation set the foundation for resilience that can ensure operational success regardless of the threat or environment. Cyber exercising: The cornerstone of cyber resilience Cyber exercises must be integrated into our security strategy to truly strengthen cyber resilience. These structured simulations test an organisation’s readiness against real-world cyber threats. They help teams practice incident response, refine decision-making processes, clarify communications channels, assure roles and responsibilities, test assumptions, hone tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and build confidence in crises. From critical infrastructure to corporate enterprises, cyber exercising equips teams with the practical experience to respond with clarity and speed. Whether defending national infrastructure or safeguarding sensitive customer data, these exercises transform static response plans into living capabilities. Cyber exercising goes beyond routine cybersecurity awareness training. While annual training sessions and e-learning modules provide foundational knowledge, they often fail to prepare employees for high-pressure, real-world attacks. Research from Cornell University highlights that experiential learning – engaging multiple senses through real-world challenges – significantly enhances knowledge retention and engagement. The study notes that while people generally remember 10% of what they read and 20% of what they hear, retention rates can reach as high as 75% when all senses are engaged in hands-on experiences. Cyber exercises create an immersive, hands-on experience where participants actively respond to evolving threats. This dynamic approach fosters muscle memory, ensuring that teams react swiftly and effectively when faced with a real cyber crisis, as they become intimately familiar with processes that they would otherwise only use in an actual incident. The more tailored the scenarios, the greater the impact. Generic, one-size-fits-all exercises may offer surface-level value. Still, they often fail to expose the real vulnerabilities or test the actual decision-making dynamics unique to a specific organisation. Truly effective cyber exercises must be context-driven, designed around the systems, processes, people, and risks that define your operational reality. This approach ensures that participants don’t just go through the motions – they experience realistic dilemmas, respond to plausible threats, and see the direct implications of their actions on critical assets. It builds credible muscle memory and reveals how your actual infrastructure and teams perform under duress. In addition to tailoring, there are three core elements that we believe should be part of every effective cyber exercise experience: Cross-functional involvement Simulations beyond IT teams, connecting all relevant stakeholders from across the organisation and their supply chain, ensure we capture a holistic image of an organisation’s resilience posture and preparedness for breach. Realistic threat simulations Employing the latest Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that real-world threat actors use ensures the training is relevant and impactful. Measurable outcomes Post-exercise assessments provide actionable insights at every level, helping organisations continuously improve their security posture. Why cyber exercising matters Reveals critical gaps in technical controls, escalation paths, and decision-making workflows. Fosters organisation-wide collaboration, improving coordination and communication across all roles, functions, and levels. Builds confidence under pressure, giving participants, groups, and organisations muscle memory they can rely on. Exposes participants to real-world attack techniques, improving detection, containment, and familiarity. Strengthens regulatory and stakeholder alignment by stress-testing notification and reporting procedures in a simulated environment. Fosters a culture of continuous improvement by turning lessons from exercises into actionable changes across people, processes, and technologies. There are different ways to test your defences Cybersecurity exercises are vital for preparing organisations against cyber threats, primarily split into tabletop and operations-based types. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based, where teams role-play hypothetical scenarios, such as ransomware, to refine response plans and improve coordination without impacting real systems. Operations-based exercises are hands-on simulations of real incidents, testing practical response skills and operational readiness under pressure. Individually, tabletop exercises enhance strategic planning and communication, while operations-based ones build technical proficiency. Together in a Test, Training, and Exercise (TT&E) program, they form a comprehensive preparedness framework that combines planning with practical testing to bolster overall cyber defence. Tabletop exercises: Strengthening communication and crisis readiness Tabletop exercises are critical for refining crisis response in a controlled, low-risk environment. In our recent tabletop exercise with a large organisation’s communications team, we facilitated a scenario-driven exercise that simulated a cyber incident unfolding in real-time. The goal: to evaluate communication flows, stress-test decision-making, and prepare the team for the pressures of a live cyber crisis. The exercise revealed key insights: Crisis coordination mechanisms require refinement to ensure seamless collaboration among internal stakeholders and external partners during rapidly evolving incidents. Decision-making under pressure remains a challenge, underscoring the need for more regular, scenario-based training to build confidence in high-stakes situations. Strong internal relationships are a resilience multiplier, enabling faster alignment and more cohesive communication in moments of uncertainty. Third-party coordination protocols need to be formalised, particularly in managing external investigative teams and vendors during an incident lifecycle. Single points of failure can manifest as a result of churn, rapid growth, untested assumptions, and any number of other causes; regardless, they significantly negatively impact resilience when triggered. These findings drove targeted improvements across communication workflows, escalation protocols, and stakeholder engagement strategies, sharpening the team’s ability to communicate effectively and own the narrative during future cyber events. These outcomes are exactly what tabletop exercises are designed to produce: clear, actionable improvements in team performance and process maturity. Operational exercises: Real-world attack simulations For cybersecurity and IT teams, technical hands-on exercises provide an immersive, real-time experience in responding to cyberattacks. These simulations replicate real-world threats, allowing defenders to detect, mitigate, and recover from incidents. During one of our recent national cyber exercises, participants engaged in a highly realistic, live-fire environment that closely mirrored the intensity and complexity of a real-world cyberattack on critical national infrastructure. Leveraging federated cyber ranges and connected industrial control system environments, the exercise enabled cross-functional teams – including Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) and Central Security Operations Centre (CSOC) staff – to practice identifying, containing, and recovering from sustained and multi-layered attacks. Participants were challenged to manage incidents in real-time, make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information, and maintain situational awareness under pressure – all while sustaining operational continuity. Key outcomes included: Strengthening the ability to detect and respond to hybrid IT/OT threats in high-stakes environments. Enhancing coordination between field teams, CSOC analysts, and external regulatory and security entities. Providing invaluable exposure to realistic threat actor behaviours, improving defenders’ situational awareness and agility. Identifying process and tooling gaps that would be difficult to uncover outside a simulated crisis. Providing a mechanism to practice communication processes between incident responders and the senior leadership, translating events into business impact. By embedding hands-on technical simulations into their resilience strategy, participating organisations gained tactical readiness and deepened institutional understanding of how cyber events unfold – and how to lead effectively when they do. Case study: Enhancing cyber resilience in critical infrastructure sector We conducted a comprehensive cyber resilience exercise within the civil nuclear sector, to enhance the sector’s preparedness against increasingly sophisticated cyber and hybrid threats. The exercise brought together experts from nuclear plants, transport solutions, and cybersecurity agencies to improve incident management, collaboration, and crisis communication. The exercise aimed to address the challenges posed by sophisticated threat actors, complex supply and stakeholder chains, as well as complex converged IT, OT, and IIoT technical environments, all while simulating large-scale cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. With the global energy sector experiencing a 74% increase in cyberattacks over the past year alone, and the nuclear industry being a high-value target for geopolitical adversaries, the threat is no longer theoretical – it is urgent, persistent, and evolving. The main objectives of the exercise were to: Train Incident Response Teams (RRTs) and Central Security Operations Centres (CSOCs) in cyber incident management. Enhance communication skills and collaboration during crises. Evaluate the integration of IT and OT systems in responding to cyber threats. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The exercise simulated cyberattacks from a fictional geopolitical entity involving key nuclear and cybersecurity stakeholders. Pre-event training prepared participants with the necessary skills and knowledge on cyber threats and incident response. An essential component of the exercise was the After Action Report (AAR), which rigorously evaluated team and organisational performance. The AAR captured detailed insights into what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve. Following the recommendations, participating organisations were able to close identified vulnerabilities, reduce incident response time by up to 30%, and update response plans to reflect real-world threat dynamics. Moreover, the structured debriefing process improved internal coordination scores across teams by 40% compared to baseline assessments conducted prior to the exercise. These measurable improvements have since informed investment decisions, governance updates, and the design of future training initiatives. Participating organisations were able to close identified vulnerabilities, reduce incident response time, and update response plans to reflect real-world threat dynamics. 30% reduced incident response time 40% improved internal coordination score The exercise highlighted key areas for improvement, such as leadership under pressure and IT/OT coordination. It demonstrated that only through regular, organisation-specific exercises – combined with thorough AAR analysis – can organisations in critical infrastructure stay ahead of rapidly advancing threats and build the operational muscle memory required to respond with confidence and speed. Don’t wait for an attack to test your defences As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, organizations that fail to prepare risk severe financial and reputational damage. Integrating cyber exercises into your security strategy empowers your teams, strengthens defences, and builds a truly resilient organization. The question is not whether you will face a cyber incident but how prepared you are when it happens .

    "content": "Case study July 7, 2025 by Nortal Testing the cyber defences of a life sciences company A well-executed cyber exercise can mean the difference between a contained incident and a costly crisis. One global life sciences company put this to the test – and emerged significantly more resilient. Explore our cyber exercises Service Cyber Resilience Industry Industry An international life sciences and clinical research company headquartered in the United States has an admirable mission – to enable its customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. However, with global cybercrime costs growing by 15% annually, to deliver that promise to its 350,000 customers worldwide – rather than become the weak link in their supply chains – the company needed to evolve from a strong, functional security model to a world-class, fully integrated resilience programme that matched its market leadership and the critical nature of the supply chains it supports. The ripple effect The company commands a roughly 20% share of the global market, reflecting its extensive portfolio, which includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, clinical diagnostic laboratories, research institutions, and government agencies worldwide. But this also means the company is deeply embedded in vital supply chains, and a cyberattack could ripple across critical infrastructure and essential operations – not only in life sciences, but also in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, academia, and even national security-related research. For example, a breach in networked lab instruments and data management software could allow threat actors to push malicious updates or manipulate lab results. A cyberattack could result in delays to cancer diagnostics and critical therapies. Contrary to popular belief, technology is not the sole answer to cyber threats. Studies show that 82% of cyber breaches involve human error – but those same people can also become your strongest defence against cyberattacks. An FBI report noted that 53% of digital medical devices in the US are at risk of cyberattacks. Attack simulation A sound approach today is to assume a cyber incident will happen – after all, it’s a question of when, not if, you will be attacked. Being able to respond rapidly and effectively is critical to containing the financial, operational, and reputational impacts of that incident and in returning to normal operations. An expert response, however, doesn’t come naturally. It must be ingrained in muscle memory through exercise. To meet our client’s challenge, we designed and facilitated multiple tabletop exercises for the company’s global leadership and communications teams to move beyond theoretical plans and test their capabilities against a highly realistic, modern threat scenario. Our attack campaign simulated assaults on a core product line, creating downstream impacts on customers and triggering regulatory scrutiny. To mirror today’s information battlefield, the scenarios also included AI-generated deepfake content of the CEO, designed to sow confusion and damage public trust. We provided expert analysis after observing how the teams collaborated under pressure. This approach aligns with the proactive validation now expected by advanced regulations such as NIS2 and DORA, which require organisations in critical sectors to demonstrate their resilience in practice. The exercises initiated vital discussions on leadership roles, crisis coordination, and communication protocols, providing a safe environment in which to navigate the pressures of a real-world cyberattack. Enhanced incident preparedness The exercises delivered a comprehensive, executive-endorsed blueprint for advancing the organisation’s cyber maturity, ensuring its people, processes, technology, and culture are prepared for the future. Instead of reacting to a real crisis, the company is now proactively implementing a strategic roadmap built on insights from the exercises. Key impacts include: A framework for scalable response The exercise provided the business case for enhancing the company's incident management framework. Leadership is now equipped with a clear plan to implement a robust cross-training programme, ensuring a deep and scalable bench of talent ready to respond effectively. A plan for strategic communications The simulation delivered a strategic framework for maturing the company’s crisis communications. This has provided a clear path for establishing a formal ‘battle rhythm’ and developing a proactive messaging arsenal, preparing the team to control the narrative in a contested information space. A roadmap for integrated security The engagement produced a strategic roadmap for embedding a ‘Security by Design’ ethos across the product lifecycle. This has laid the groundwork for a ‘Security Champions’ programme, with plans to embed security expertise directly within R&D teams and foster a culture of shared ownership. By rehearsing for a crisis, this life sciences leader not only fortified its own defences, but also strengthened the integrity of the entire ecosystem it serves. In a sector where trust is paramount, and one weak link can halt vital services, preparedness is a collective asset . Don't wait for an attack to test your defences As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, organizations that fail to prepare risk severe financial and reputational damage.

    "content": "Case study July 3, 2023 Digitalized delivery procedures save drivers time and improve customer experience Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable raw materials for the chemical and polymer industries. They also develop chemical recycling of plastic waste to combat the plastic waste problem. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Nortal digitalized Neste’s driver’s processes, which have improved the security and reliability of Neste’s deliveries. Streamlining order and delivery information by digitalizing information sharing, Neste and their drivers are now providing their customers with faster and better quality service. Challenge Neste’s challenge was to speed up the flow of information and at the same time ensuring its accuracy and making the drivers’ job easier. Prior to the TOIMI solution, Neste’s drivers received printed consignment notes from the distribution terminal and manually entered the unloaded quantities. At the end of the day, the drivers brought the consignment notes back to the terminal, where the information was, once again, manually transferred into the office system. All of this manual work resulted in a delay of 2 to 4 days from unloading the cargo to sending the invoice. Every nation’s paperwork requirements are different, and requirements may differ at institutions within a nation. One university in Spain may want your high school diploma, another requires proof of income eligibility for scholarships. Different documents are needed and they are uploaded and downloaded on different platforms. When accessing hundreds of legacy systems across which data is scattered, users’ documents are located in a variety of government offices working in silos, making it time consuming to get documents for opening a business, changing schools, or any other bureaucratic task. Multiple log-ins may be required to chase down information and, at the personal level, it becomes an exercise in frustration. At the societal level, it’s a massive waste of resources. Calculations show that for the European Union, a single digital gateway (SDG) could help companies save 11 billion euros, and relieve citizens of 885,000 hours of labor. Solution Designed according to Neste’s business processes and needs, this new feature in the TOIMI system manages and controls the flow of oil products from to the end customer and the recording of freight data. This feature includes positioning systems for better route planning and navigation, which enable the drivers to provide more accurate delivery times for customers. Manual data is no longer needed, as the TOIMI system now functions with the delivery car’s equipment through in-car interfaces we created. To implement this solution, we used MS Visual Studio 2017 premium C#, HERE map data provided by Esri, and Esri’s ArcGIS pro routing engine. Timeline The system is now in use in around 140 vehicles, making around 500 000 customer visits per year. The operational vehicle system is equipped with a 4G data connection to the office system. 1998 The TOIMI system is taken into production use. 2005 The positioning information features are introduced. 2006 In 2006, a sealing feature was built into the system to provide proof of integrity, i.e. the quantity and quality of the oil product delivered to the final customer is the same as the product loaded at the terminal. 2015 The entire system is upgraded to a 64-bit environment. 2015 The entire system is upgraded to a 64-bit environment. Neste The TOIMI system has brought us clear service level and and image advantage compared to our competitors petroleum products in the transport of oil products. Our cooperation with Nortal has been of significant importance for us to achieve these benefits. Impact This new feature in the TOIMI system speeds up delivery management significantly providing accurate up-to-date data available for the drivers. As the drivers can see open orders directly in their trucks and can therefore deliver the product left in the load to the customer who needs it. In-car interfaces eliminate human-induced keystroke errors and detailed positioning, and map data reduce the risk of delivering products to the wrong addresses. The location of the car can be continuously monitored from a GPS device. The system keeps track of the total quantity of product they have on board and enables a near real-time view of the order book. Drivers can also browse, modify and send out delivery information, freight reports or queries directly from their trucks to the admin system. From the customer’s point of view, the digitalization of this process has improved the the security and reliability of deliveries. Streamlining order and delivery information by digitalizing information sharing, Neste Oil and their drivers are now providing their customers with faster and better quality service. Less manual work overall Less time spent on processing and invoicing deliveries. Deliveries are now invoiced the following night. The manual work at the terminal was reduced and processing of delivery quantities considerably speeded up. Faster delivery and delivery process Improved customer service, map, address and routing data. Optimal route selection and estimating the time of arrival. Versatile interfaces and connections to office system The drivers’ work becomes faster and easier, because all the necessary information is available and up-to-date.

    "title": "Real-time intelligence with Microsoft Fabric: A deep dive into the manufacturing industry",
    "content": "Blog April 3, 2025 by Parthsarthi Raghavan, Data Engineer, Nortal Finland Real-time intelligence with Microsoft Fabric: A deep dive into the manufacturing industry It might surprise you to learn that unplanned downtime can cost manufacturers up to $260,000 per hour, as highlighted by industry research on IIoT World. Leveraging real‑time intelligence is key to preventing these costly disruptions. In the fast-paced world of the manufacturing industry, real-time intelligence is not just a luxury - it’s a necessity. With increasing demands for efficiency, sustainability, and precision, the ability to process, analyze, and act on data in real-time has become a game-changer. In this blog, I’ll share insights from a recent project that challenged our team to rethink how data can solve operational bottlenecks while addressing a critical hurdle: ensuring adoption by shopfloor operators. Service Data and AI Industry Data and AI So, why is real-time intelligence such a game-changer? Because in today’s data-driven world, reacting quickly is no longer enough - businesses need to anticipate and act before issues arise. Real-time intelligence empowers businesses to make informed decisions instantly, and in the manufacturing industry, this can translate into: Real- t ime i ntelligence: W hy i t m atters Minimized downtime: Proactively resolving equipment issues before they escalate. Optimized production: Adjusting parameters in real-time to meet fluctuating demand. Improved quality control: Detecting defects instantly, reducing waste by 15-20% in pilot phases. In this particular project, Microsoft Fabric’s ability to integrate real-time data streams from diverse sources and deliver actionable insights was the cornerstone of achieving these outcomes. A r eal- l ife i mplementation: manufacturing c ase Our client, a global manufacturer, was striving to keep up with increasing production demands while minimizing downtime and waste. They were hindered by three critical challenges: Fragmented data systems: Insights were delayed due to siloed systems that couldn't communicate effectively with each other. Costly downtime: Maintenance was reactive, leading to high downtime costs that significantly impacted profitability. Technology resistance: Shopfloor teams were accustomed to manual processes and sceptical of adopting new systems. To address these challenges, our team collaborated closely with our customer to develop a data-driven solution tailored to their needs. As a Data Engineer on this project, my responsibilities included: Data modelling: I designed star-schema models to structure real-time machine data, enabling efficient analytics and simplifying complex datasets for actionable insights. API development: To bridge the gap between systems, I built RESTful APIs that connected SAP with Fabric’s EventHouse via MQTT and EventHub, ensuring seamless data flow and system interoperability. Data governance: Establishing a \"single source of truth\" was critical. I standardized data definitions and validation rules, ensuring analysts could rely on consistent and accurate information. Real-time intelligence management: I oversaw the end-to-end management of Fabric’s real-time data pipelines, optimizing performance to achieve sub-500ms latency for critical alerts and notifications. Elevating operational efficiency We began by connecting IoT data sources, including machine data from Kepware, Ignition, MQTT, and EventHub to Fabric’s EventHouse (Kusto Database). This integration enabled centralized and processed over 12,000 data points per minute, creating a unified data foundation critical for real-time insights. However, working with legacy systems presented a unique challenge. Many lacked APIs, requiring us to develop custom connectors to ensure seamless data flow between systems. By building intuitive real-time dashboards, we provided operators with live insights into line performance, enabling immediate corrective actions. These real-time dashboards are like having Google Maps for your production line - know where the traffic jams are before you’re stuck in them. With this current integration, workers also gained access to real-time safety protocols and training modules directly on the factory floor. This integration could reduce incident rates by up to 25% and increase overall safety awareness. The potential impressive results of this impact could include: 18 percent reduction in downtime within 3 months. 30 percent faster decision-making by operators using dashboards. 6 months to achieve ROI despite initial adoption hurdles. The result is a robust, integrated solution that empowered operators with real-time insights while reducing reliance on outdated, manual processes. By addressing both the technical and human aspects of implementation, we are able to ensure the solution's success across all levels of the organization. Key f eatures of Microsoft Fabric in a ction : As mentioned, Microsoft Fabric played a central role in transforming how data was collected, processed, and utilized . By leveraging its robust capabilities, the solution we built not only enhance s operational efficiency but also foster s collaboration and improved safety. Here are a few key features of Microsoft Fabric and how they came to life in this implementation : Unified data architecture Fabric’s seamless integration across data pipelines allows for real-time ingestion and processing of data from machines via Kepware, integrated with Ignition, and then transmitted through MQTT to EventHub before being ingested into Fabric’s EventHouse (Kusto Database). This setup enabled us to capture machine performance and production data efficiently. Think of your data pipeline as your internet connection - faster is better, but reliability is key. Don’t let your data packets “buffer.” Real-time analytics With Fabric’s Synapse Real-Time Analytics capabilities, we processed high-velocity data streams to identify bottlenecks and enhance production monitoring. If you’ve ever waited for a 10GB file to upload, you’ll appreciate why low-latency analytics feels like upgrading from dial-up to fiber optic. Collaborative workflows Fabric’s unified platform brought together data engineers, analysts, and domain experts, fostering collaboration. This streamlined workflows and accelerated decision-making during the implementation phase. It’s like having all your teammates in the same Slack channel - minus the memes (but we wouldn’t complain if Fabric added that feature). Integration for operational health and safety In a key enhancement, we integrated a solution into our operations to support health and safety initiatives. This solution’s digital platform provided real-time access to training materials, incident reporting, and safety updates, ensuring a safer work environment and boosting compliance. Treat your safety data like an IT backup - always accessible and updated, because you never know when you’ll need it. Personal insights: The real impact of real-time intelligence Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. In my role I had the opportunity to design scalable data models and build integrations that truly made an impact on real-world operations. One of the biggest \"aha\" moments for me was seeing how real-time intelligence isn't just about technology - it's about changing the way people work. Initially, shopfloor operators were sceptical of the real-time dashboards, preferring their manual tracking methods. Instead of forcing adoption, we took another approach and worked closely with them to understand their workflows, address their concerns, and gradually demonstrate how real-time data could make their jobs easier rather than more complicated. Another key takeaway was the power of unified data architecture. Bringing together IoT, SAP, and Microsoft Fabric into a single, streamlined pipeline not only reduced downtime but also improved decision-making at every level - from operators on the floor to leadership teams analyzing trends. At Nortal, we don’t just build solutions - we rethink how technology integrates into business workflows. Seeing our work result in 18% downtime reduction and a 30% increase in operator efficiency made all the long hours and problem-solving absolutely worth it. If you’re passionate about data, problem-solving, and making a real impact, Fabric and Nortal provide an exciting playground to do just that! While Microsoft Fabric transformed our client’s operations, the human element was truly the key to success in this project. By blending technical expertise with empathy for end-users, we turned resistance into enthusiasm. As one operator remarked, “Now I can actually fix problems before my shift ends.” So, in conclusion, with this project we’ve proven that real-time intelligence isn’t just about data - it’s about empowering people. Conclusion As with all architectural decisions, the platform approach has trade-offs, and it is impossible to recommend a one-size-fits-all approach. Well-executed platform architecture can offer multiple benefits, such as accelerated delivery, TCO per application, and consistent user experience. On the other hand, the platform has lifecycle costs, requires good engineering skills, and it is not easy to calculate the ROI beforehand. However, by focusing on measurable outcomes and continuous improvement, you can demonstrate the value of your platform over time. To start your platform journey, it's crucial to approach platform development strategically and understand your organization's specific needs and goals. By starting small, focusing on measurable outcomes, and prioritizing alignment between technology and business, you can harness the full potential of platform engineering and build a foundation for sustainable growth. With the rise of AI and automation, platforms will become even more intelligent and adaptable, further streamlining development and operations.

    "content": "Article May 26, 2025 Revolutionizing your factory operations Nortal's Edge Platform stands on 30 years of industrial experience. Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Manufacturing Data and AI Imagine a digital factory where machines communicate seamlessly, data is processed in real-time, mission-critical applications are deployed in minutes, and AI-powered decisions are made without delay. Then imagine dozens of such factories – your factories – running globally. This is what edge computing promises to you, the industrial technology decision-maker. Processing data closer to where it's produced, rather than sending it all to the cloud, is crucial for applications that require extremely low latencies in functions like predictive maintenance, quality control, or worker safety. Such can be, e.g., a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusts its actions based on real-time system feedback to maintain a desired production quality level, or a real-time video surveillance application to prevent the paths of humans and automated forklifts from colliding at a factory site. In addition to eliminating latencies, local data processing ensures that operations can continue even if the connection to the central cloud is lost. From s ilos to c onsistent c ompany- w ide e dge c omputing The benefits of edge computing are clear, and the technology for edge computing has existed for at least a decade. However, the commonly adopted approach of implementing edge computing separately at each factory as siloed projects has often led to redundant efforts, increased costs, and a lack of central government and monitoring. Nortal’s vision for the “next-generation edge platform” is to deploy, monitor, and manage applications at the edge using the same tools and practices we use in the public cloud, i.e., to extend the cloud computing principles to the edge. The grounding principles are the same as those for any technology platform, as described in Nortal’s previous post by Aki Pehkonen: to enable the business to move faster and more efficiently towards its goals. We have designed Nortal's Edge Platform to unlock the full potential of edge computing in large industrial settings, and we’ve already started piloting the approach with a leading customer. Based on our experience in the industrial landscape, the benefits of next-generation edge platform can be manifold for corporations with many sites globally: Agility and speed: With a common platform and processes, deploying and managing applications across your factories is faster and easier, new innovative solutions can be developed and scaled more agilely, and the silos between information technology and operational (IT/OT) systems can be broken to ultilize all accessible data more efficiently. Cost Efficiency : Centralized management and deployment of applications and the capabilities created for remote operations reduce your infrastructure and personnel costs, and removing overlapping solutions enables savings. Risk Mitigation: Security protocols that are the same for all factories reduce the risk of breaches and ensure compliance with industry standards. Nortal’s edge platform’s open approach to technology vendors allows you to choose the best solutions and avoid vendor lock-in and related risks. AI Readiness: Standardized tools and processes allow you to scale AI innovations and models to all factories “in minutes.\" The Edge Platform simplifies the deployment and management of Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) models in production, while ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost management. How to s tep u p y our g ame with Nortal's e dge p latform While many edge platform solutions may lead to vendor lock-in and closed environments, our approach is different. We have developed an open, cloud-native edge platform based on open standards and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects. This approach enables you to choose the right tools and avoid vendor lock-ins. Our platform supports applications from various vendors, allowing you to select the best, most cost-effective components for your needs, fully benefit from the investments you have already made, and innovate more efficiently. With our extensive experience working with leading industrial customers and their OT/IT environments, we help you make the best architecture choices for your business. Our edge platform is based on a composable architecture and covers five key layers that can consist of the technology solutions you prefer : Infrastructure : Utilizing tools like Azure Local, the foundational layer includes physical and virtual resources in your factories’ on-premises server room that ensure high availability and reliability, e.g., networking components, storage systems, and hardware resources. Compute : With Kubernetes technology at its core, the compute entity includes virtual machines and containers that execute the application logic and data processing. It also enables rapid deployment and consistent management of containerized applications across all factory locations. Core Services: Standardized core services capabilities such as databases, APIs, integrations, and message brokers make application development and deployments easier and ensure all necessary data is available for your applications. Applications: The development and deployment of containerized applications for your business and operational needs stay in your hands and those of your selected application development vendors, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. The platform ensures seamless interaction with the underlying data and core services. Management in the Cloud: Tools like Azure Arc enable the deployment, management, and monitoring of the above-mentioned edge resources and workloads. The edge platform offers a single control panel across your global factories. With this next-generation Edge Platform, Nortal can help you efficiently, securely, and scalably orchestrate the entity described above across your factory sites. Our guidelines and best practices are based on our 30 years of expertise in industrial environments. Still, the platform allows you to continue to benefit from your current infrastructure, application partners, and tools to implement the edge computing architecture and processes best suited to your operational needs. The time is now Switching to a next-generation Edge Platform is not just a tech upgrade but a smart move that can improve how your factories work, make them safer, and save money. Edge computing supports digital transformation technologies like the Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These technologies rely on low-latency, high-bandwidth data processing, which edge computing can provide. Edge computing lowers costs and emissions by diminishing the need to send data over networks, reduces security and compliance risks, and keeps operations running even if the cloud connection is lost. Real-time decision-making speeds up innovation cycles and helps improve customer experience. Emerging technologies from Microsoft, such as Azure Local and Azure Arc, make edge computing easier, cheaper, and accessible for more companies than before. These tools let you use the same methods in local setups as in the public cloud, making your local factory operations more straightforward and secure. Investing in edge computing now helps build systems that can grow and adapt to future technological needs, ensuring long-term business success and flexibility.

    "title": "What are platforms, and do I need one?",
    "content": "Article April 2, 2025 by Aki Pehkonen, Head of Cloud, Nortal Finland What are platforms, and do I need one? Back in the day, when I started my software engineering career, most of the custom enterprise applications were built using a single tech stack. A few of the most common ones were a Java stack with an Oracle database or a Microsoft stack with an SQL Server database. At that time, a typical enterprise system was a product family of desktop applications with a two-tier architecture organized in a monolith codebase. Service Data and AI Industry Data and AI From frameworks to platforms Since enterprise applications typically have shared concerns, such as handling database connections, localization, authentication and authorization, logging, release management, etc., the standard approach was to create a foundation framework for these capabilities to create a consistent architecture. Although this approach works reasonably well, the downside is that it often creates a steeper learning curve to understand its conventions and structures and might limit the ability to use more modern approaches. Luckily, most of these development concerns have already been solved in modern application frameworks such as Spring Boot or ASP.NET. In most cases, those frameworks already offer most of the foundational capabilities, and they are extensible with commercial and open source to solve more specific use cases. Software architecture has evolved a lot in the last 20 years. Instead of monolith applications, mainstream enterprise applications are collections of distributed (micro)services that communicate with each other via HTTP and are deployed to the public cloud. The same type of architecture is also widely used in commercial SaaS applications, and when done right, the distributed nature of the architecture is not visible to the end user. Although distributed application architectures are more flexible and scalable when appropriately done, they also have tradeoffs with architecture and deployment complexity. While solving the increasing complexity of emerging architectures, the software industry has coined a new term, Platform Engineering, which is typically a set of services, tooling, and guidance for engineers to autonomously build new capabilities that meet domain requirements in a repeatable way. At its core, it is not very different from the old-school framework development, and the purpose is the same: let engineering teams focus on the application logic and streamline deployment and operations while maintaining alignment with the ecosystem. What are internal development platforms and platform engineering? The idea of Internal Development Platforms (IDPs) has roots in the original platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings like Heroku and Cloud Foundry and the internal development platforms built by large tech companies such as Google, Netflix, and Spotify. The fundamental goal is to reduce the cognitive load on developers by creating opinionated, pre-configured workflows that developers can use to deliver value faster while avoiding repetitive infrastructure setups. Also, mainstream cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have their own PaaS offerings. The latest generation of their PaaS products are container-based and serverless, with a usage-based pricing model that almost entirely abstracts away complex parts such as container orchestrations. PaaS services have an easier learning curve, but at the same time, they are less flexible and may not be cost-efficient when used at scale. In addition to the general-purpose PaaS services, there’s also a movement to more specialized and higher abstraction level platforms, such as integration, low-code, and data platforms — some attempt to democratize the development process and allow more people to contribute. Good examples of these services are Microsoft’s Power Platform and Microsoft Fabric, which many Nortal customers are adopting now. In most cases, internal development platforms are not built on bare metal; they are a combination of capabilities to deliver specific workloads. For example, an integration platform can provide capabilities different from those of a data platform. Still, both should offer APIs and self-service capabilities to allow multiple teams to deliver value independently without the ticket-driven approach common for traditional IT infrastructures. For the solutions running in the public cloud, the IDP can be a curated list of available capabilities or an enabling layer for on-prem infrastructure to build cloud-native services. In this context, the platform engineering team is responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting the IDP for the rest of the organization. To some extent, platform engineering is an evolution from DevOps practices; instead of building non-functional system qualities in an ad-hoc manner, platform engineering is an attempt to productize and standardize these capabilities on the platform. Team topologies and Platform Engineering Any platform engineering initiative success heavily depends on the organizational structure and how teams interact. The principles of Team Topologies , a model developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais, provide a valuable framework for aligning teams with platform development and consumption. The basic idea of team topologies comes from Conway’s Law , which states that “ organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations” . In simpler terms, how your teams communicate directly influences the architecture of your software. The Team Topologies leverage this idea by offering practical advice on deliberately structuring the team to reflect the desired architectural structure. This approach is often called a reverse or inverse Conway’s Maneuver; instead of fighting against Conway’s Law, it leverages it to drive the desired change. Team Topologies identifies four fundamental team types: Stream-Aligned Teams These teams are responsible for delivering end-to-end value to customers. They should be able to work autonomously and own their services throughout their life cycle. Enabling Teams These teams provide specialized expertise and guidance to Stream-Aligned Teams, helping them adopt new technologies and practices. They act as consultants and collaborators. Complicated-Subsystem Teams These teams handle complex or specialized subsystems that require deep expertise. They build and maintain components that are difficult for Stream-Aligned Teams to manage. Platform Teams These teams are responsible for building and maintaining the internal development platform. They provide the tools, services, and infrastructure that Stream-Aligned Teams need to deliver value. The most critical team types in platform engineering are Stream-Aligned Teams and Platform Teams, where Stream-Aligned teams consume the platform and deliver business value. The platform team maintains and develops the platform itself. Adopting Team Topologies' principles helps define clear responsibilities and create necessary feedback loops between the teams for continuous improvements. Team structures should not be set in stone so the team compositions can adapt when the platform matures or the business changes. Many times, it also makes sense to switch roles once in a while to understand different aspects and needs of the platform. For example, if applicable, it is helpful for platform engineers to work alongside the stream-aligned team to understand the pain points of consuming the platform. Do you need a platform? Creating and maintaining a platform is not a project but an internal product line that requires the same practices, principles, and lifecycle management as any other software product. This is a significant undertaking, so before deciding to build your platform, it is crucial to determine the benefits your organization seeks to gain with the platform and how applicable they are to your domain. In general, platforms seek to benefit from economies of scale. The most obvious candidates for platforms are ecosystems with potentially multiple applications that require consistency or fewer applications but a considerable number of environments to deploy them. A good example of a platform with multiple applications is an application suite that covers a specific domain with small, focused applications that aim to provide a consistent user experience. This consistent user experience gives the illusion of using just one application, although technically, different sections on the screen might come from various sources. An example of many environments is an edge platform where applications can be deployed and updated automatically to the whole fleet of IoT devices or other edge services. In short, consider these questions to determine if a platform is right for you: Do you have multiple development teams working on related projects Are you experiencing significant duplication of effort in infrastructure setup or deployment? Do you want to enforce consistent security or compliance standards across your applications? Do you have a large number of deployments? Are you going to be deploying to edge locations or devices? Do you need to provide consistent user experience across multiple applications? The cost of not having the platform when you need one, is increased development efforts due to duplicated work, inconsistent security postures, and a slower time to market. Where to start? Regardless of the platform type, platform engineering seeks to deliver value more efficiently. To be truly impactful, this requires both strategic and technical thinking. While the technical side is concerned with having the right tools and infrastructure, the strategic side must align the platform with business goals, operational efficiency, and future growth. Ideally, a good starting point should be well-understood, not overly massive, and offer measurable outcomes. This is always a balancing act between complexity and business value; making it too small won’t provide tangible benefits but making it too big too early increases the risk of failure. Either way, failure means losing the organization’s momentum. Therefore, it is best to start with an MVP platform to receive feedback and improve based on actual needs. My advice is to come up with something that: Aligns technology and business goals Platform engineering isn’t just building tech to deliver even more tech but enabling the business to move faster and more efficiently. In essence, the question is: What does the business want to achieve, and how can technology help to get there? Questions : What are your long-term goals (e.g., faster time-to-market, create new product offering) Can the platform reduce existing costs? Do you want to tap into new revenue streams? (e.g., monetize existing assets, utilize a partner network) Can the platform deliver a better customer experience? Example: If a business goal is to enter new markets quickly, the platform should support scaling and deployments to multiple regions with reasonable cost and effort. Depending on the target regions, this might impact the platform for compliance and regulatory reasons. Operational Efficiency Very few companies worldwide don’t need to care about operational efficiency; it is not just about margins but also about staying competitive and providing better service at lower costs. Therefore, it makes sense to consider operational efficiency very early in the project. Strategic goals: Normalizing the tech stack helps manage the technical debt Reusable assets help build new capabilities with lower costs Standardized software delivery to reduce operational costs and optimize resource usage Example: A standardized cookie-cutter approach to delivering new applications means that each team creates the applications similarly, reducing errors and speeding up the delivery process. Is future proof Building a simplified user experience over a collection of open-source tools and various services requires pre-made decisions and defaults that limit the options that platform users need to make. The approach has a built-in trap; each simplification is one step away from the base platform and its APIs, and even when it seems like a simplification to the makers of the platform, it will be another layer of abstraction that consumers must learn. In most cases, it makes sense to use well-known standards and protocols. Strategic benefits: Ability to react to market changes Ability to adapt and integrate with new technologies, like AI Example: Modular architecture that communicates with other modules via well-defined APIs is adaptable to change, whilst the normalized platform allows for the maintenance of operational efficiency. Conclusion As with all architectural decisions, the platform approach has trade-offs, and it is impossible to recommend a one-size-fits-all approach. Well-executed platform architecture can offer multiple benefits, such as accelerated delivery, TCO per application, and consistent user experience. On the other hand, the platform has lifecycle costs, requires good engineering skills, and it is not easy to calculate the ROI beforehand. However, by focusing on measurable outcomes and continuous improvement, you can demonstrate the value of your platform over time. To start your platform journey, it's crucial to approach platform development strategically and understand your organization's specific needs and goals. By starting small, focusing on measurable outcomes, and prioritizing alignment between technology and business, you can harness the full potential of platform engineering and build a foundation for sustainable growth. With the rise of AI and automation, platforms will become even more intelligent and adaptable, further streamlining development and operations.

    "content": "Home Insights Microsoft Fabric is everywhere Article December 18, 2024 by Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland Microsoft Fabric is everywhere And if you’re on Power BI, you are already in! Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Manufacturing A few months ago, we at Nortal decided to pull a list of Finnish Data Architects , Chief Data Officers, and other data decision-makers from different industries . We started contacting them with the message of Fabric , Microsoft’s end-to-end analytics SaaS platform that unifies data from diverse operational and information technology systems. It has been astonishing to witness the level of engagement among the respondents of this outreach, as it has already yielded dozens of interactions with interested prospective customers for us . Fabric is coming in through doors and windows As one of the prospective customers put it: “Fabric is coming in through doors and windows, now.” No matter if your company or organization already has an existing data platform or is just considering investing in one, the flexibility of Microsoft Fabric means nobody needs to miss out on the opportunity to adopt an agile platform and its AI tools to make sense of the data stored in different systems around the organization . And the best part is that you may already be on t his train! Nortal pioneers with the pioneering Microsoft Fabric Microsoft Fabric’s appeal lies in its unique features: Its agile nature as a SaaS solution that allows for quick setup times and eliminates the need for infrastructure management, its OneLake storage approach that supports the modern data lakehouse architecture, and it offers a seamlessly integrated data and AI experience that is familiar from Microsoft’s Azure. Although many of the platform’s possibilities have been on the market for some time in other solutions, the agility of deployment and time-to-value are unprecedented. Nortal is proud to be part of a select group of frontrunner partners who work actively and hands-on with Microsoft Fabric. Our recognition as a Microsoft Fabric Featured Partner is a testament to our recent experience deploying real-life customer solutions on Fabric. Unlock the power of unified data solutions with Microsoft Fabric Learn more about our Microsoft Fabric expertise – Petri Rönkkö, Vice President Forest, Manufacturing and Services, Nortal Finland We're helping numerous customers who want to try something new on the side of their existing data platform, are entirely new to data platforms, or are seeking to overcome the challenges with their previous data platform projects. Microsoft Fabric Kick-Start: born from our experiences With Nortal’s expertise from years of building Azure-based data platforms and workloads and working with tens of customer organizations, we have identified six concrete steps to get started with Microsoft Fabric and test it with real-life use cases . As we speak, we are applying these steps to our pioneering customers. Six steps and 4 – 8 weeks to a platform pilot First, we will scope the project to map the use cases in focus and the business value the customer wants to pull from them. A design-first approach ensures we understand the end-user’s needs and consider the solutions’ usability. Second, the data is modeled, and data architecture, Fabric capacity strategy, and governance are carefully designed to ensure that we build a scalable solution that suits future needs. Third, we will implement the solution separately in test, development, and production environments to allow further development without interfering with everyday business. Fourth, thorough testing always needs to be done from the viewpoints of the functionality, the integrations, the performance, and the end-user experience. As the fifth step, it is vital to train the customer’s end-users to ensure that knowledge is efficiently transferred from Nortal’s project team to the customer experts. Finally, we provide our customers with comprehensive solution documentation that includes the architecture decisions made during the pilot and the description of support mechanisms. This ensures that the solution keeps adding value to the customer’s business now and in the future. Although these six steps may seem laborious, they are crucial for the success of a data platform pilot project – no matter how agile the technology solution in question is. Also, with our well-thought-through process, the duration of all six steps can be squeezed to as little as four to eight weeks. While Microsoft Fabric as a solution is lightweight and scalable, so should the projects that help you prove its viability and usefulness. You may already be on the right train As pointed out , it is almost surprising how many Finnish organizations are already looking at Microsoft Fabric , be their business in manufacturing, financial services, professional services, or the public sector. The delightful finding for many may be that if you are using PowerBI , you probably already are on the Microsoft Fabric wagon. Microsoft Fabric capacity will replace Power BI capacity licenses Microsoft has announced that Microsoft Fabric capacity licenses will replace Power BI Premium per capacity licenses. While Power BI enjoys the position as the leading business intelligence solution, holding more than one-third of the business intelligence market, it is likely that most of the leading organizations already have licenses for it. The change means that as a Power BI Premium customer, you will need to switch your existing Power BI Premium capacities to the new Fabric capacities at your next renewal. Once in Fabric, you’ll have access toother Fabric experiences, better integration with Azure services, and more flexible billing options, ensuring a seamless upgrade from pure Power BI to Microsoft Fabric without losing access to your current workspaces and data. Thus, the upcoming changes in Power BI licensing present new opportunities to leverage all the features of the Fabric platform instead of being limited to reporting only. However, this also introduces a challenge: when capacity is shared among Power BI and the other capabilities of Fabric, your organization might encounter a situation where capacity runs out from, e.g., the daily Power BI reporting. To avoid such disruptions in the accustomed reporting services, it is essential to have a skilled partner that can develop a Fabric capacity strategy. Such a strategy optimizes capacity acquisition for different domains and ensures that, for example, your data scientists and reporting have their dedicated resources in Fabric. So, without knowing, you may already be on board with what we consider the most interesting business analytics solution available today. With Nortal’s Microsoft Fabric Kick-Start concept, the risk and effort of proofing and implementing this new technology is minimal, while the potential benefits for your business could be massive.

    "content": "Home Insights Four concrete steps to more sustain(profi)table operations Article January 6, 2025 Four concrete steps to more sustain(profi)table operations While the summer of ’69 may have seemed to last forever, as Bryan Adams sang, the summer of ’24 vanished in a flash, leaving us with a stark reminder of the urgent need to act on sustainable business practices. The global heatwave in June that affected over 60% of the world’s population, and the life-threatening heat experienced in what were once European summer paradises underscore the pressing need for immediate action. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources As operational leaders and parents, we have a moral responsibility to embed genuine green practices into our businesses. Our role is pivotal in driving sustainability, but at the same time, we must balance this with our accountability for quarterly profit and growth. Combining profit with sustainability At Nortal, we have seen numerous customer cases where sustainability and profitability – luckily – are two sides of the same transformational coin. In today’s technological environment, this transformation revolves around data. With a few attainable data steps, you can achieve two things: transparency and action. Greener practices are not just mandated by law but also offer substantial financial incentives from the government. Therefore, transparency has become a must. With Nortal, our customers have harnessed their data and gained noticeable tax benefits in fields where, e.g., the use of sustainable fuel is compensated – if there’s reliable data to prove it. The most important outcome from data, however, is action: what business decisions you make, which actions you take, and do you find the equilibrium where responsible action, in the long run, goes parallel with your business’s short-run prosperity. Our earlier article from May -24 explored how data and digital technologies can enable sustainability, especially in industries like energy and metals. In the most recent writing , we showcased our customers who have successfully made their business operations data-driven. This article will introduce four concrete steps to help you achieve the transparency needed to drive more sustainably profitable operations. Step 1: Turn data into business language Your journey towards more transparent, sustainable, and profitable operations begins by structuring your group’s data into identifiable, traceable, and combinable entities that your businesses can utilize. You will first want to identify the business domains whose data correlates with your sustainability metrics. Good first suspects are, e.g., procurement from the viewpoint of supply chain transparency, production from the sense of reducing waste, and HR to decrease the number of accidents and close calls. Data owners from these functions should help organize and translate data into business terms. This makes data a valuable resource for everyone in your organization, allowing for better decision-making and more efficient operations. The actions in this first step may already reveal invaluable insights to steer your business. This was the case with one of Nortal’s customers, a Finnish pioneer of consumer online services. Translating existing data into business language revealed a case of misuse in their online system for end-users. Eliminating this single fraud case yielded savings of several hundreds of thousands for the customer. Step 2: Make operational data operational Integrating Operational Technology (OT), i.e., the hardware and software systems that monitor your physical processes and devices, with Information Technology (IT) ensures that operational data is always at your fingertips. It’s like having a real-time pulse on every aspect of your operations. Thus, this is your second step. A great example of using data from operational systems is the Finnish textile service company Lindström . Lindström commissioned Nortal to help automate a process related to tailoring their rental clothes to each customer’s needs. All the systems supporting the daily production business were interconnected in the project, allowing the information to flow automatically. The new, automated process yielded productivity improvements that surpassed Lindström’s expectations and shortened the garment manufacturing lead time from weeks to one day. On top of the productivity leaps and cost reductions, such data usage breakthroughs usually also diminish operations’ environmental footprint by reducing waste, energy consumption, or emissions. Step 3: Hire the tireless assistant you always wanted: AI By fully integrating AI and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities with your data, you unlock the power of predictive analytics , which helps optimize operations and reduce waste. As your third step, AI-driven analysis can become the super-intelligent assistant that tirelessly identif ies patterns and trends that human analysis might miss, leading to more sustainable and profitable business practices. An example of AI in action in Nortal’s customer base is Europe’s leading stainless steel producer , Outokumpu . We built a surface defect detection system that helps Outokumpu understand defects and root causes like never before. Based on AI and ML, the system evaluates steel coils to the degree of detail and consistency that no human eye can. Customers get the required quality, production flows can be optimized, and coils with problems are repaired or rerouted early. Defects identified earlier mean lower costs in storage, rejected materials, and customer claims, and root cause identification enables long-term optimization. As in this case, the KPIs leading in the discussion are often financial. However, improving the quality and reducing waste in energy-intensive fields like steel production will undoubtedly also positively impact the environmental metrics. Step 4: Start your innovation engine If data is today’s fuel, then innovation is your business’s data-powered engine. Enriching business operations with unique components invented on data and AI can, at its best, differentiate you from competitors. An essential fourth step and an enabler for harnessing data for innovation is encouraging your IT department to adopt a composable architecture framework instead of building rigid, point-to-point integrations between your systems. Composable architecture allows the creation and rebuilding of systems as needed, just like Lego blocks. This caters to flexibility in adapting to changes quickly and continuously innovating new ways of doing things. Continuous innovation, in turn, ensures long-term sustainability and profitability, as with our customer, food service provider Compass Group . Compass Group’s operational and financial steering is based on the data model built by Nortal. The model boosts creativity in Compass Group’s business domains and helps automate processes. Compass Group has, for example, increased the quality and accuracy of food production and significantly reduced manual routine work, such as complying with sustainability reporting requirements for work and product safety. How will the summer of ’69 turn out? Fast forward to 2069, where we will hopefully find ourselves at the culmination of decades of persistent efforts to create a more sustainable and greener world. By then, we should have witnessed the successful integration of AI and data analytics into every facet of our lives, enabling us to make informed decisions that benefit both people and the planet. The extent to which those decisions have helped us slow down or even stop the current concerning developments depends on our ability to tap into the possibilities of today’s technology.

    "title": "Unlocking Manufacturing Insights with Microsoft Fabric",
    "content": "Home Insights Unlocking Manufacturing Insights with Microsoft Fabric Article May 22, 2024 by Petri Rönkkö, Head of Business Area, Forest, Manufacturing & Services (FMS) Unlocking Manufacturing Insights with Microsoft Fabric Manufacturing is a data-intensive industry, generating massive amounts of information from various sources, such as sensors, machines and enterprise systems. However, often this data remains siloed and underutilized in the different factories or siloed systems around the globe, limiting the potential for data-driven insights and innovation over all data sources. Microsoft Fabric, a fully managed data analytics platform, is designed to address these challenges and accelerate data-driven industrial transformation. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Manufacturing What Is Microsoft Fabric and Real-Time Intelligence ? Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that unifies data from both operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) systems. It helps the democratization of data by providing a unified data estate, enabling easy access and analysis for different data consumers. Fabric’s OneLake approach helps tier down data silos by connecting different data sources and provides one unified user experience across different Fabric services in the platform. Source: Microsoft Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) integrates and streamlines the end-to-end journey of working with streams and event data. Customers benefit from its ease of working with streams and its ability to respond to events. Combined with Real-Time Hub and experience of having all the streams under a single pane of glass with the Real-Time Hub, makes solution a great fit for real-time streaming use cases. With the ability to add triggers and alerts to those streams in Real-Time Hub, you can have a responsive system to everything that is happening. Let’s explore Microsoft Fabric benefits for the manufacturing industry: 1. Unifying d ata ac ross OT and IT s ystems As mentioned, the manufacturing industry generates information from various sources, from factory machines, manufacturing execution systems (MES), enterprise resource planning systems (ERP) and many other OT or IT systems. For real-time integration and streaming scenarios, RTI is a great fit. RTI is designed to handle high velocity streaming data, making it suitable for many manufacturing scenarios where large volumes of data are managed, and data insight and experiences are based on data in motion. Examples of high-velocity data sources are IoT telemetry data, process data from factory production lines, automation systems PLC, logs, or similar. RTI is also a great fit if you need to work with the time-series data, like production historians in manufacturing. Real-Time Intelligence Platform’s important services within the Fabric are Eventstream and Eventhouse. Eventstreams are the way to easily bring streaming data into Fabric from multiple sources and route this data to various destinations, including Eventhouse. Eventhouse is a database workspace designed to manage and store event-based data. It’s optimized for high granularity, velocity, and low latency streaming data. Real-Time hub is the hub for all streaming data. For non-real-time integration needs, you can use traditional ETL batch processes to integrate data from various IT systems to Fabric Lakehouse using Fabric Data Explorer. By combining both OT (Operational Technology) and IT data within the Fabric OneLake, manufacturers gain a comprehensive view of their operations and key performance indicators (KPIs). This harmonization leads to better decision-making, deeper insights, and optimized processes across both manufacturing and business operations. 2. Accelerating Time-to-Insight Because Microsoft Fabric is a fully managed Data Analytics Platform, there is no need to manage infrastructure anymore, Microsoft manages it for you. This not only reduces development times and allows faster deployments but also saves maintenance costs. The benefit of a fully managed platform is that the organization can focus on building analytics solutions rather than managing infrastructure. Another aspect for accelerating time-to-insight is the standardization of development. Using standardized protocols like OPC-UA and common data models can significantly contribute to this goal. The manufacturing industry data model within Microsoft Fabric (currently in preview) is designed to enhance Manufacturing Operations Management (MoM) and accelerate time-to-insight. Its goal is to empower production teams to make informed, data-driven decisions and elevate operational efficiency across the factory floor. The model follows the industry-standard International Society of Automation (ISA-95) information model, aiming to streamline and standardize data management in manufacturing. By unifying, enriching, and modelling manufacturing data in a standardized way, the manufacturing industry data model enables manufacturers to accelerate time-to-insight generation. 3. Copilot Templates for Factory Operations Copilot Templates for Factory Operations is an initiative within Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing . Its primary purpose is to assist in interpreting complex data from factory operations. Fabric introduces for example Copilot templates for frontline workers. These templates allow natural language interactions with their own data. Workers can perform tasks, such as root-cause analysis, knowledge discovery, training, issue resolution, and asset maintenance using their unified data. Copilot Templates are powered by Azure OpenAI Service, providing generative AI solutions against the manufacturer’s own data. Building unified data estate in Microsoft Fabric is a foundation for efficient use of AI, allowing it to be more efficient when all the data from OT/IT systems are stored to one centralized platform and ready to be utilized by AI and Copilot. Developer Experience Microsoft Fabric provides one unified user experience across different Fabric services in the platform. Fabric services are built based on familiar tools like Data Factory, Data Explorer (KQL, Kusto Query Language) and Synapse Analytics and PowerBI. Developers can use familiar tools and technologies like SQL, Python, Spark, Notebooks or KQL to build analytics solutions in the Fabric. This makes Microsoft Fabric an easy platform to adopt and learning curve low. Combining to the fact that it’s fully management platform and developer doesn’t need to worry about infrastructure setup, allows developers start experimenting Fabric fast. Fabric’s developer experience is enhanced by its seamless integration with Azure services like Azure AI, Azure IoT Operations, Azure API Management or Event Hubs. A migration path is also available from Azure Data Explorer to Eventhouse, making Fabric adoption seamless for existing users. Conclusion Microsoft Fabric helps the manufacturing industry by unifying data across different sources , empowering factory frontline workers, and accelerating operational data insights . Its seamless integration with Azure ensures a developer-friendly experience, ultimately speeding up analytics solutions time-to-market . Microsoft Real-time Intelligence allows organizations to analyze data in motion and provides real-time insights. This is crucial for scenarios where timely actions are essential. In Manufacturing, RTI helps optimize operations by monitoring processes, detecting anomalies, and triggering alerts for better Operational Efficiency. RTI can also be used for predictive maintenance use cases identifying equipment issues before they cause failures. In these kinds of scenarios, RTI helps minimize downtime and reduces maintenance costs.

    "content": "Home Insights Five steps to revolutionize Occupational Health and Safety in your factory with AI Article April 22, 2024 by Jukka Kostiainen, Value Architect at Nortal Five steps to revolutionize Occupational Health and Safety in your factory with AI Prioritizing occupational health and safety (OHS) is crucial in the industrial landscape. AI presents a modern solution to revolutionize OHS practices and improve workplace safety. In this article, we present five key steps to harness AI’s potential and enhance safety protocols in manufacturing. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Enterprise Industry Manufacturing As the decision-maker and the responsible lead for your factory’s Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), you know your numbers: for a single tragic accidental death in the workplace, there are 30 severe injuries, 300 injuries with less serious consequences, and a whopping 3,000 near-miss situations. During your tenure, you would want to avoid anything – anything at all – from happening to your employees. The thought alone of someone getting severely injured or dying would be devastating. This is where the latest AI innovations come in. AI presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize OHS practices and enhance workplace safety. Through data collection and management, deployment of modern AI tools, and the right cultural mindset, your organization can leverage technology to predict, prevent, and ultimately protect your workforce, making a life-changing difference in your factory. Next, I will introduce the five practical steps to harness AI’s potential and transform your OHS practices. #1. Optimize your data collection processes In manufacturing and forest industries, OHS organizations work hard towards continuous improvement and preventing accidents from happening in factories. In this era of data and analysis, many new ways have emerged to predict misfortunes and identify harmful patterns. However, one of the biggest challenges is the manual collection of safety-related data. It is a time-consuming and tedious process, often involving Excel sheets and forms, both digital and on paper. Even organizations that are generally advanced in digitalization and have efficient tools for collaboration and teamwork may experience collecting safety-related data, which consumes extensive amounts of time, both on the shop floor and at the headquarters. To address this challenge, the OHS data projects’ initial focus is to refine data collection processes. This step is critical to ensure that experts’ time is utilized efficiently and that redundant tasks are minimized. One way to do this is by leveraging Microsoft Power Platform’s low-code tools , through which organizations can swiftly develop mobile apps that streamline reporting and data submission, simplifying operations across all levels of the organization. It enables getting actionable insights on data without massive projects, steep investments, or writing custom applications whose maintenance and updates might prove problematic. If – and when – optimizing your data collection processes in your manufacturing environment was easy and fast, why wouldn’t you do it? #2. Optimize your data management In addition to refining data collection methods, the efforts should often extend to a comprehensive overhaul of the entire data infrastructure and collection. This includes redefining the types of data collected and the methods employed, exploring possibilities for spatial data integration, and devising strategies for merging data from diverse sources. The intricacies of report generation should be delved into, ensuring that insights are gleaned and effectively communicated through visualizations that offer clarity and depth. Moreover, implementing actionable measures should be strategized based on these insights, such as targeted safety campaigns aimed at areas identified as vulnerable to security breaches or incidents. The overarching goal is to achieve a harmonized approach to data collection, formatting, and storage across the organization. By consolidating these elements under a unified management scheme, the barriers that isolate safety as a standalone silo can be braked. This integration facilitates a holistic analysis of OHS data, allowing us to uncover new perspectives on factors such as quality, production, and HR practices that influence workplace safety outcomes.

Ride the AI wave on analysis Once your factory’s gathering, storing, and categorizing of data are appropriately planned, the deployment of modern AI tools becomes feasible. Through such tools, we have assisted our customers in identifying trends and patterns that might otherwise remain unnoticed. For instance, we’ve uncovered near-miss situations often associated with under-resourcing, heavy overtime burdens, or exceptional factory maintenance work. This proactive approach can effectively prevent accidents and injuries before they occur. For instance, many of our global manufacturing customers are keen to enhance their comprehension of near-misses and risk levels within their factories. Collaborating with us, they’ve developed, for example, a mobile application for their health and safety professionals and the entire organization, operating at both international and factory levels. This application can harness AI capabilities to discern trends and patterns in the data. The insights gleaned can then inform the development of highly targeted safety campaigns. For instance, a “thumbs campaign” could be launched in regions with recorded similar thumb-related incidents. This campaign would address the specific risks associated with thumb-related injuries and offer actionable advice on prevention. Rather than focusing solely on investigating isolated incidents across numerous global factories, the daily work of a global OHS team should prioritize gaining a comprehensive understanding of overarching trends and patterns. While the data should still facilitate the examination of specific near-misses, the emphasis should be on leveraging analytics to assess the broader picture when necessary. This enables the team to determine whether launching preventive campaigns organization-wide is warranted, potentially safeguarding numerous individuals from harm. An additional valuable application of AI in analysis involves analyzing how different parts of the organization complete their near-miss forms. Relying solely on the low or mid-range of the severity scale may indicate a culture of secrecy regarding safety issues. Identifying such patterns within vast data would typically require months of manual effort. However, a well-trained AI model can swiftly detect these patterns in seconds. The concept of a digital twin in industrial settings holds significant promise for enhancing safety protocols, among other applications. By creating an exact digital replica of a specific factory, area, or production line, near-misses or accidents can be spatially recorded with pinpoint accuracy. This eliminates any possibility of misunderstanding and is a powerful tool for mitigating risks. Digital twins exemplify a standardized approach to data modeling, minimizing the potential for interpretation errors or human oversight. #4. Let generative AI speak for itself The latest advancement in leveraging AI for industrial OHS lies in generative AI technologies. These technologies enable humans to interact with safety and health data, among other insights, in intuitive and familiar ways, such as through common language text, speech, or visual images. An illustrative example applicable to many of our customers is the implementation of an OHS chatbot. This chatbot enables users to engage via text, seamlessly responding to ad hoc queries, such as comparing production data to safety abnormalities. Through our experimentation with generative AI chatbots, we have observed significant benefits, including the ability to overcome language barriers that often impede OHS collaboration and may lead to misunderstandings and risky situations in international organizations. #5. Mind the culture – always The potential of AI to revolutionize Occupational Health and Safety practices cannot be overstated. By leveraging AI to collect and analyze safety data, organizations can identify trends, patterns, and hazardous workflows that might go unnoticed. Moreover, AI enables a proactive approach to safety by predicting and preventing accidents before they occur rather than reacting after the fact. The utilization of generative AI further enhances these efforts by overcoming language barriers and accommodating varying safety habits and working methods. While the steps and examples presented may suggest a straightforward path to a safer working environment, it’s essential to recognize that even the most advanced AI-powered reporting cannot inherently alter behavior on the shop floor. Culture remains paramount, as it always has. Enhancing safety culture involves making safety data visible to employees on the factory floor and ensuring that reports, applications, chatbots, and insights are accessible in the right locations at the right times. However, genuine change in underlying beliefs and routines will only occur when people’s mindsets shift. Hence, individuals always have the ultimate responsibility for fostering a culture of health and safety. While technology serves as a powerful tool, enabling individuals to allocate their time toward impactful preventive measures rather than dwelling on past incidents, it is not the sole solution. Long-term improvements in workplace safety hinge upon nurturing a safety culture where employees authentically prioritize their well-being and that of their colleagues daily. Want to know more?

Yet, the journey from data analysis to actionable insights may still feel like a labyrinth of manual effort, relying heavily on scarce resources like data scientists and subject matter experts. But fear not – this is where the latest AI innovations come in, offering a path from data analysis to continuous improvement, revolutionizing how you operate while unlocking a realm of possibilities, from predictive maintenance to streamlined decision-making. With AI, industrial organizations can seamlessly bridge the gap between structured and unstructured data, liberating experts from manual analysis and propelling them toward success. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Enterprise Industry Every executive in resource-intensive industries, like manufacturing or forest, knows that efficient data utilization – both structured and unstructured – makes or breaks businesses today. As my colleague Ergin Tuganay wrote in his earlier article , there is often a gap between an organization’s systematic and structured data and the unstructured “silent” data. The challenge is to digitally collect, store, analyze, understand, and act upon the daily data your operations generate. This data can be anything from well-structured records from your ERP system to side marks written by your maintenance specialists when they fixed a broken valve ten years ago, but both are just as invaluable. Your organization might have had its silent and structured data digitized and, in the early days, already built a robust data platform and strategy . If you are lucky, you have enjoyed the benefits of getting informative insights from data and having that data available to those who need it regardless of time and place. However, analysis is still a tedious task. It requires your scarce data scientists and subject matter experts to crunch bits and pieces of information to build those documents or Power BI reports that fit their purpose and are understandable for the users at all levels of the organization. This is where the latest AI innovations come in. With AI, you can free your valuable experts from continuous data analysis to constant improvement in quality control, predictive maintenance, workplace safety, sustainable manufacturing practices, and more. Explore more insights Article Five steps to revolutionize Occupational Health and Safety in your factory with AI Article A game-changer – turning industrial ESG reporting from a hurdle into an opportunity AI – an opportunity for continuous improvement Rooted in the Japanese philosophy of “Kaizen,” continuous improvement emphasizes minor, incremental enhancements over time. AI can significantly simplify and streamline the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle that guides iterative enhancements. Therefore, it provides a step change, especially in the root cause analysis and building an action plan. Through methodologies like Pareto Analysis, Six Sigma, and AI-boosted Root Cause Analysis, organizations can prioritize efforts, aim for perfection, and predict or even prevent deviations with remarkable precision and efficiency. This convergence of AI and continuous improvement accelerates problem-solving and empowers organizations to stay ahead in a competitive marketplace, ushering in a new era of innovation and excellence. But where to start? #1 Prioritize with Pareto Analysis The 80/20 rule, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto, states that approximately 80% of effects stem from 20% of causes. In the context of continuous improvement, Pareto analysis helps prioritize efforts. Organizations can achieve significant gains by focusing on the 20% of factors that drive most inefficiencies or defects. This could, for example, mean analyzing structured classified information like downtime by reason, a section of a production line, or the most maintenance-intensive machinery by equipment type. #2 Aim at perfection with Six Sigma Six Sigma, in turn, aims to minimize defects and variations by achieving near-perfect processes. A good example would be the setup time when making product changes. As there may be noticeable variations between individual setups and even teams, understanding the underlying reasons helps reduce variation, prevent worst cases, and improve the average. #3 Perform AI-boosted Root Cause Analysis to predict and prevent To identify the root causes of deviations, AI tools can help find patterns or recommend solutions and related corrective and preventive actions based on your past analyses and unstructured data sources like diaries. Have we had similar cases earlier? What is related to similar equipment in our global RCA (Root Cause Analysis) library? AI’s Large Language Models (LLM) even let us use data in RCA reports written in languages we cannot understand. The time spent on analysis is cut from weeks or days to minutes or even seconds. With proper root cause analysis and actions based on it, organizations can predict and prevent similar incidents from happening again. In addition to the analysis phase, LLM also streamlines the planning of recommended corrective and preventive actions, work instructions, and Standard Operating Procedure documentation. Harness Microsoft’s AI billions to continuously improve your production efficiency The latest AI tools can streamline your decision-making, generate predictions that boost your performance and competitiveness, and optimize the planning of follow-up actions. Generative AI can help you analyze and extract insights from unstructured data, such as images, videos, audio, and sporadic diary texts. Combined with telemetry and event data, LLM can find correlations that have been impossible to detect using traditional statistical tools or previous AI methods like deep learning. Microsoft’s AI solutions, like Microsoft Copilot, assist in ideating novel solutions based on your organization’s digital data throughout the process. Finally, generative AI and LLMs allow your experts to interact with this data in natural language and through AI-generated illustrations without taking time for lengthy training on the correct commands. The synergy of continuous improvement, Pareto analysis, Six Sigma, and AI-boosted root cause analyses propels organizations toward excellence. Microsoft is at the forefront of AI development, with billions invested in OpenAI and its technologies.

    "title": "How digitalization makes energy and metals businesses greener and more profitable",
    "content": "Home Insights How digitalization makes energy and metals businesses greener and more profitable Article November 25, 2024 How digitalization makes energy and metals businesses greener and more profitable Energy and metal enterprises face mounting pressure to evolve in response to increasing sustainability targets. Merely harboring good intentions falls short of satisfying the varying demands of investors, climate goals, and the drive for profitability. However, the strategic adoption of digitalization emerges as a vital solution, bridging the gap between environmental stewardship and economic performance. In this article, we’ll explore how digital transformation can further green initiatives and serve as a lever for financial success, detailing the multifaceted impact on operations, decision-making, and resource optimization within the energy and metal sectors. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Energy and Resources Digitalization acts as a catalyst to drive operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. Businesses can streamline and accelerate adaptive operations by integrating modern technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) alongside composable architecture patterns. Digitalization empowers employees with tools that automate routine tasks, provide real-time data for informed decision-making, and streamline communication. This enables them to focus their energies on more strategic, value-added activities and enhance their productivity and efficiency in the workplace. In addition, digital tools offer real-time monitoring capabilities for swift identification and correction of operational inefficiencies. Digital platforms facilitate seamless collaboration between departments and stakeholders, improving coordination and accelerating project timelines. Through digitizing documents and processes, enterprises can reduce paper usage and physical storage needs, fostering an organized and efficient working environment. Overall, digitalization transforms operations to be more agile, responsive, and aligned with modern business needs, driving productivity and cost-effectiveness. Data-driven decision-making for resource optimization Digitalization empowers energy and metal enterprises to adopt data-driven decision-making, which is essential for optimizing resources. Leveraging advanced data analytics, AI, and ML, companies derive actionable insights from complex datasets. Additionally, digitalization facilitates the consolidation and standardization of data across diverse contracts and operational frameworks. This transparency enables businesses to grasp the impact of various operational strategies on resource allocation and utilization. The critical element here is transparency. When all facets of the operation are visible and quantifiable, businesses can begin the optimization process. This is not merely about seeing the numbers but understanding their interplay to predict outcomes and draft more efficient strategies. Full transparency enables AI and ML models to unleash their true capabilities by analyzing interconnected data. These advanced technologies transcend simple data aggregation, providing in-depth analysis to reveal patterns and trends that inform resource deployment and operational efficiency. However, data traceability and reliability are the prerequisites for these models to add value. Inconsistent or inaccessible foundational data may inadvertently divert AI resources toward rectifying and connecting data points rather than analyzing and optimizing them. Through accurate data capturing and curation, organizations can leverage AI to focus on optimization strategies. ML algorithms can help identify the most cost-effective materials and energy use, forecast demand more accurately, and minimize waste—powering a more streamlined operation that maximizes resources and drives down costs. Furthermore, this data-driven approach allows continuous learning and improvement. As AI models digest new data, they refine their predictions and recommendations. Consequently, energy and metal enterprises are better positioned to respond to immediate operational challenges and can also adapt strategic plans for sustainable profitability. Renewable energy adoption and cost savings As the metal and energy sectors move toward more sustainable operations by integrating solar, wind, and biofuel energy sources (among others), digitalization is the linchpin that ensures this transition is cost-effective and operationally efficient. First, digitalization facilitates the management of variable energy inputs inherent in renewable sources. For example, solar or wind power availability can be unpredictable, with varying output levels depending on environmental conditions. Advanced digital systems can predict these fluctuations and adjust operations accordingly, enabling a more dynamic alignment between energy supply and enterprise demand. Using predictive analytics, businesses can capitalize on periods of high renewable energy generation. Moreover, digital sensors and smart grids offer real-time monitoring and control over energy usage, allowing enterprises to seamlessly switch between renewable and conventional energy sources based on availability and cost. This not only maximizes the use of greener energy but also avoids peak tariff periods. Furthermore, digitalization opens avenues to engage in energy trading platforms where excess renewable energy can be sold, creating an additional revenue stream. Supply chain transparency and eco-friendly sourcing For energy and metal enterprises, materials sourcing significantly impacts the supply regions’ ecosystem and social fabric. Thus, supply chain transparency is a critical component in promoting eco-friendly practices. Transparency is about seeing into the intricate web of suppliers, transporters, and distributors involved in the delivery of products; moreover, it’s about understanding the provenance and lifecycle impacts of materials and ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards. Digital technologies play a key role in enabling such transparency. Digital systems enable information integration across the supply chain, facilitating a holistic view of the sourcing process. For example, IoT devices can track the movement of goods and monitor the conditions of transportation; advanced analytical tools can then process this data to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or practices that may be environmentally detrimental. Additionally, digital platforms allow for integrating external parties’ information—such as suppliers’ environmental certifications or third-party audits—into the decision-making process. This helps companies enforce sustainability policies throughout their supply chains by setting clear requirements for suppliers. Carbon footprint reduction through smart technologies Smart tech is crucial in driving efficiencies and enabling better resource management. Integrating IoT, smart sensors, and AI allows industries to monitor and optimize energy usage, minimize waste, and streamline processes—all of which contribute to a lower carbon footprint. IoT devices and smart sensors can be deployed across an enterprise to gather vast amounts of real-time data, which, when analyzed, provide invaluable insights into energy consumption patterns. These technologies can monitor the energy usage of machines and systems, identifying unnecessary or excessive consumption. Energy-intensive processes can then be optimized, operating only when needed and at the most efficient levels. In addition, AI algorithms can analyze collected data to predict and manage the operational load. Rigorously forecasting peak times and adjusting usage accordingly helps energy and metal enterprises avoid energy wastage. Smart technologies also facilitate preventive maintenance by predicting when machines or components will likely fail or require servicing. This prolongs equipment lifespan and maintains optimal performance. Digital platforms can also aid in implementing a circular economy by enhancing recycling processes and material tracking, leading to more sustainable resource use and less environmental impact. Economic incentives and government initiatives External factors like economic incentives and government initiatives also nudge enterprises toward environmentally sustainable practices. These incentives often offset the initial costs of going green and encourage long-term investment in sustainable business models. Subsidies and grants are key pillars of this support structure. Tax credits directly lower the tax liability for companies investing in renewable energy projects, energy-efficient technologies, and emission reduction measures. These credits reduce the overall cost of implementing green technologies, making the investment more financially viable. For instance, investment in wind and solar power assets or biofuel prioritization may be subsidized through tax credits, reducing the payback period and improving the return on investment. Grants are another accessible form of government support, providing enterprises with capital to pursue sustainability projects without repaying funds. Grants can cover a range of activities from research and development to green infrastructure deployment; by lowering the financial barriers to entry, grants make it feasible for companies of all sizes to contribute to the broader green agenda. Digitalization is often at the heart of these initiatives, as modernizing industrial processes through digital technologies can lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and resource management. Digital tracking and reporting can also more readily capture government incentives for adopting renewable energy. Automated compliance reporting simplifies claiming subsidies, tax breaks, or credits. For example, our Finnish branch has implemented a system for one of our clients in the food industry to collect and trace feedstock biocriteria from renewable energy feedstock collection through production and distribution. In addition to tracking movements, the solution also logs changes in sustainability parameters during transportation and feedstock processing. The solution helps allocate biocriteria, respect the valuation of different sustainability parameters for other markets, and create accurate sustainability certificates for produced energy. This extra layer of supply chain visibility assists with meeting renewable energy directives and maximizes additional value gains from grants or tax credits that demand precise record-keeping. Embracing Digitalization for Sustainability Digitalization stands as a transformative force for energy and metal enterprises seeking to balance sustainability and profitability. By leveraging modern technologies and data-driven insights, companies can streamline operations, optimize resources, and reduce their environmental footprint. However, this journey requires a commitment to innovation, collaboration, and cultural change. Yet, the potential rewards are significant—a greener, more prosperous future where sustainability and profitability go hand in hand.

    "title": "From painful to smooth releases: How we optimized our client's release process",
    "content": "Case study March 30, 2023 From painful to smooth releases: How we optimized our client's release process Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Telecommunication and Media Like so many companies, our client struggled with their release process as it was mired in inefficiency. The process was prone to mistakes and demanded a significant amount of manual labor to deploy. However, their system didn’t start off this way but was a victim of the company’s own success. When a project grows too fast for its own DevOps processes to keep up, it becomes riddled with issues. Things like the deployment of updates and new features are plagued by delays or disruptions that cause a ripple effect of negative business consequences. This often happens due to an initial lack of automation or DevOps and leads to the processes being manually implemented. At first, this seems manageable – set up the database and deploy the application. However, as the business grows, the requirements start rolling in and it becomes overwhelming, devouring the capacity of the team. Challenge Our client, a large telecommunications company, knew they must take action to modernize their release process. With their eye on improving speed, accuracy, and efficiency they turned to Nortal to find the optimal solution that would meet their need of streamlined update releases. With the help of our devoted DevOps team focused on building, merging, and deploying the code we were able to bring new features and updates to fruition. Each step of the process was completed by hand – configurations applied, databases changed – to ensure that the final product would be a success. The tireless workers on our release team spent their time poring over written instructions to secure a smooth release. Approach Originally, they were manually managing 10+ environments, so we felt creating a branch for each new environment seemed the easiest solution. The previous process looked like this: Best case scenario of a single journey from development to production with all environments refreshed with the latest code would take: This is assuming there aren’t any defect fixes being merged into releases and there were always defect fixes. Did we mention there was also a specific sequence of how libraries had to be built? Because all of this was manually accomplished, it’s not hard to imagine that over time their capacity to deliver new features and updates ground to a halt. Releases became an irregular and often painful occurrence that only took place once or twice a month. The lack of a regular cadence made it hard to predict when new features would be available and disrupted the ability to plan and execute the roadmap. It was a frustrating situation for our client to be in, and because of our long standing relationship, one they trusted us to address in order to get back on track. Solution Branching strategy Tailoring a release process to the client’s needs is essential. We started by selecting from a few of the more standard branching strategies and cross-referenced our clients’ needs: Trunk based Gitflow Github flow Gitlab flow Since they tended to have heavy parallel development, it was not uncommon to have six-months of features in progress and developed in parallel. Multiple ongoi ng releases were still a reality with a cadence of two-week sprints, and we needed a way to keep the cargo of each sprint separate. The control of exactly what goes into production was still extremely tight. Hotfixes were an especially challenging issue when you mix in multiple-release cargos. Lastly, our client would also sometimes have customer-specific testing feature branches, which we also needed to handle. Keeping all the above requirements in mind, we opted for a standard Gitflow approach. While still one of the most complex branching strategies, we felt if automated sufficiently, it would provide our client with the most business value. For the more visual amongst us: To meet the client’s need for scalability the best solution was to eliminate any human intervention. Every aspect in the picture above ended up being automated. If automation is creating branches for all 50+ code repositories, it doesn’t matter how many you have or how often you need to do it. We can create a release branch of development automatically. We can create a feature branch off development or any release tag automatically. We can create a hotfix branch off any release tag automatically. We programmed a specific build sequence, eliminating any tribal knowledge and always having a place to refer to for the correct sequence. Merge conflicts had been another huge pain point so another aspect of this was to automate merging and back-merging. Any change in an ongoing release or hotfix branch is now automatically back merged to be developed daily (the delay is to provide room for human error when merging fixes) Once a release is deployed, it can be automatically merged to the main branch and back merged to develop for consistency. A merge to the main will automatically tag the main branch with the identifier of the release or hotfix. Deployment vision The project model was originally build-and-deploy many times over, but we needed to transition to a build-ONCE and deploy it many times model. The project had started with a one-branch-one-environment approach, which meant that built artifacts were bound to a specific environment and couldn’t be easily deployed elsewhere. This added unnecessary complexity and slowed down the delivery process. To fix this, we developed a new artifact-building solution that leveraged as much of the existing infrastructure as possible in order to keep the scope of the project manageable and deliver it quickly. By creating environment-agnostic images, we were able to eliminate a lot of the unnecessary building and code progression steps. This was the single biggest boost to our delivery speed. To provide a bit more technical detail, we had recently migrated to Kubernetes and were using Helm chart config maps to provide us with an environmental context. We used this context to connect to Spring Cloud Config and resolve environment-specific configurations. We also included a little bash script that ran at container startup and fetched environment-specific files like certificates, AppD files, and JVM options. By not baking these files into the image, we gave our client even greater flexibility to perform maintenance tasks like certificate updates smoothly. All they had to do was restart the container, and the latest and greatest files and configurations would be fetched automatically. The final piece of automation we implemented was a self-service deployment job. With just a few simple parameters—the environment to deploy to accompanied by either the release tag, release id, hotfix id, or feature id—you could let the automation take care of the rest. It would fetch the latest version of the release artifact for every deployable component, deploy it, and verify that the deployment had been completed successfully. It was a straightforward process that eliminated the need for manual intervention making deployments smoother and more reliable. Impact Implementing a solution is only half the battle—the real test comes when you roll it out. In this case, we had a tall order to fulfill—it required zero downtime and disruption to ongoing activities. We likened the task to an attempt to change the wings of an airplane mid-flight—a daunting challenge that requires careful planning and execution to be successful. It was a tongue-in-cheek comparison, but it conveyed the complexity and importance of the task at hand. While challenging, we kept it in mind from the very beginning and designed our solution with backward compatibility in mind. We reused as many existing pieces as possible and introduced no additional overhead, ensuring that the rollout would be low-risk and carefree, even if it dragged on. At any point during the rollout, we could deploy the old way or the new way, giving us the flexibility to adapt to any unforeseen circumstances. In the end, a smooth rollout is what the client will remember about the whole experience. Conclusion Overall, automating your release process and adopting a Gitflow workflow can help your team work more efficiently, accurately, and collaboratively, which can ultimately lead to higher quality software, more flexibility in the development process, and a more successful project. The speed of your business idea implementations is directly tied to the efficiency of your release process. Without a smooth and efficient way to deploy new features and updates, your business will be held back and unable to move forward as quickly as you’d like. It’s essential to prioritize and invest in improving your release process to maximize the potential of your business ideas.

    "content": "Article May 29, 2023 by Dillon Dayton, Solutions Architect Beyond marketing: How Data Clean Rooms are unlocking new possibilities for businesses If you are a CMO or marketing stakeholder, you are likely aware of the significance of data clean rooms and their marketing value with processes like customer segmentation, campaign planning or recommendation engines. However, did you know that data clean rooms can be used for much more? In this post, we’ll explore the versatility of data clean rooms and how they can be leveraged across a variety of industries and use cases to drive value. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry What are data clean rooms A data clean room is a secure environment where organizations can share and analyze data without compromising consumer privacy or corporate security. This controlled environment allows companies that would benefit from collaboration to aggregate their data and enable the incorporation of first-party data into the platform. By aggregating the data in a clean room, individual customer data is anonymized and consolidated to prevent identifying consumers. This provides a privacy-safe, secure and governed way for companies to collaborate on data analysis while maintaining a clear boundary that does not compromise competitive advantage or corporate strategies. The clean room ensures that all data used for collaboration is accurate, up-to-date and of high quality. Conventional clean rooms Data clean rooms have proven to be a valuable tool in marketing by refining customer segmentation, enriching campaign planning and helping build robust recommendation engines. With a clean room, companies can pool their data without revealing individual customer information creating a more complete view of the customer journey. For example, this allows for more effective segmentation based on demographics, interests, behaviors and more. Using this information, marketers can design more targeted campaigns with personalized messaging and product recommendations. All these benefits contribute to better customer experiences, higher engagement and increased revenue for businesses. New possibilities Data clean rooms are not limited to just marketing. New trends such as distributed data clean rooms in Snowflake integration with Unified ID 2.0 and abilities to privately enrich data with LiveRamp or Experian data and frameworks are driving value in other industries and use cases. Manufacturing companies can use data clean rooms to optimize their supply chain operations by analyzing data from multiple sources to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. Direct-to-consumer companies can gain a deeper understanding of their customers by analyzing data in a secure environment, which can help improve the overall customer experience. Even Google is investing in clean rooms as they recently released new clean room capabilities within BigQuery in a partnership with L’Oréal and Habu to better understand customers and the impact of business decisions (Gaekwad & Soares, 2023). In healthcare, for example, data clean rooms could be used in the analysis of medical records for research and drug development to increase collaboration, security and governance. Medical records contain sensitive information and must be handled with care to protect patient privacy. A data clean room could be set up to allow researchers and pharmaceutical companies to access aggregate medical data while ensuring patient anonymity and complying with data privacy regulations. Historically this was accomplished through a lengthy, complex process of anonymization and de-identification using specialized tools to transfer large data files back and forth. The speed and efficiency of clean rooms provide instantaneous data and additional protections like consent, query approval/denial and historical lineage. Leveraging a modern clean room could facilitate the development of new treatments and medications by providing insights into patient characteristics and treatment outcomes at a pace not seen before. The use of data clean rooms in healthcare could lead to more accurate diagnoses, improved treatments and better patient outcomes while maintaining privacy and protection, and using data ethically. Conclusion Data clean room s provide a secure and controlled environment for data analysis, unlocking new insights and opportunities for businesses across various industries. From manufacturing to retail, data clean room s can help many achieve value . Contact Nortal today to learn more about how data clean room s can benefit your organization.

    "content": "Home Insights Four ways to ensure success in port digitalization Article October 23, 2023 by Kadri Haufe, Head of Smart Port Advisory Four ways to ensure success in port digitalization Digitization has transformed the way ports operate. The availability and analysis of data have become key drivers for efficiency, productivity, and profitability. In this article, we will discuss why data is the key success factor in port innovation and how to ensure your port digitalization will be a success. Check out our webinar on maximizing your port efficiency Service Strategy and Transformation Industry Consumer Optimising operational efficiency One of the most significant benefits of data in port digitalization is direct contribution to operati onal efficiency. By collecting and analyzing data from various port operations such as passenger and cargo movement, as well as vessel traffic and inventory management, ports can identify areas of inefficiency and take corrective action. This in turn helps reduce turnaround time, increase throughput, and enhance overall operational performance. Lacking data-based tools for operational decision making will make your port uncompetitively expensive and/or slow. Improving customer experience In today’s compet itive landscape, providing an excellent customer experience is essential to retaining and attracting customers. By collecting and analyzing data on customer preferences and behavior, ports can personalize their services, offer targeted promotions, and prov ide a seamless experience to their customers. This helps build customer loyalty and boost revenue, while letting you stay ahead of competition against other transportation alternatives. Not unlocking the obvious benefits of data will likely result in losin g out against other transportation methods such as road, tunnel, and air. Enhancing safety and security Safety and security are critical concerns in the port industry. By collecting and analyzing data on port operations (such as vessel traffic, cargo han dling, and personnel movements), ports can identify potential safety and security risks while taking proactive measures to mitigate them. This helps ensure a safe and secure working environment for port employees and customers. Not enhancing safety and sec urity practices with actionable data will leave both people and assets exposed to avoidable risks. Making data-driven decisions Data is the foundation of informed decision-making. By collecting and analyzing data from various port operations, ports can gain insights into their performance and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, productivity, and profitability. This helps optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and improve overall performance of the port. Not basing your port development decisions on data will likely get you stuck in an expensive trial and error routine. In conclusion, data is the key success factor for succeeding in port digitalization. By collecting and analyzing data from various port operations, ports can optimize efficiency, improve customer experience, enhance safety and security, make informed decisions, and enable predictive maintenance. With the right data strategy and tools in place, ports can unlock the full potential of digitalization and achieve sustainable growth while hitting profitability goals.

    "title": "Five key trends in financial services | Nortal",
    "content": "Article June 14, 2023 by Artur Assor, Business Area Director Five key trends in financial services Service Seamless Experiences Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Financial Services Insurance After several years of transformation that has tested established institutions and disrupted the sector almost beyond recognition, financial services firms are continuing to look ahead to identify challenges and opportunities and adapt to the future. What can financial firms expect in the coming months and years? In this article, we look at five key trends that are shaping the sector. 1. Mobile-first super apps While mobile penetration varies from country to country, it is estimated that around two thirds of the world’s population own a smartphone . Consumers of financial services are predominantly mobile-first and are looking for convenience, reliability, security, and speed – and that means the ability to access their financial life through a single ‘super app’. Super apps provide users with easy and convenient access to financial services, at any time and from anywhere. But there are also clear benefits for financial services firms. A super app allows firms to access more customer data which can be used to personalize services for each user. Consolidating all services into a single super app creates economies of scale in terms of development, maintenance, and marketing. But there are risks too, not least in terms of data security. 2. Open and commodity banking The rise of open and commodity banking is a double-edged sword for established financial services firms; it is encouraging competitive fintech firms to flood into the market, but it also creates the potential for new revenue streams. These include: Subscription-based services such as personalized financial advice or premium account management services Cross-selling to existing customers Monetization of customer data (provided customer privacy is maintained and data is collected and used ethically). Open banking is encouraging the formation of mutually beneficial partnerships between fintechs and established players, including ‘white label’ arrangements, where fintechs license their technology and services for other businesses to use under their own brand in exchange for a share of revenue. 3. Modularity Success in a highly competitive market increasingly depends on an institution’s agility – their ability to respond rapidly to new opportunities and challenges and develop and integrate new services quickly. This has been particularly difficult for established institutions; legacy systems have proven a serious handicap as they try to compete with nimble tech-driven entrants to the market. In response many firms are adopting modularity, a flexible approach to developing fintech products and services that allows them to adapt to changing market conditions, emerging trends, and customer needs. By breaking down services into smaller, modular components, new features and services can be added with less disruption to the system. A modular approach allows firms to easily scale up and down and helps to manage development and innovation costs – errors can be detected early in development, helping to avoid costly mistakes, and components can often be used in new services, further reducing development time. The time-to-market is also reduced, since each component is developed and tested separately (and often concurrently). – Artur Assor, Business Area Director, Nortal Middle East and Africa AI is already revolutionizing the way customer support is provided and can also provide a route for greater personalization of the customer experience. 4. Personalization of the customer experience Artificial intelligence (AI) is already revolutionizing the way customer support is provided – chatbots can offer a reliable, 24/7 service and resolve issues quickly and efficiently. But AI also provides a route for greater personalization of the customer experience. AI and machine learning algorithms analyze both a customer’s financial data and their behavior, which allows institutions to offer personalized services and recommendations that help customers make better financial decisions. 5. Superior fraud detection and cyber resilience Fraud and cyber security are a constant challenge for all financial services firms. A recent survey by PwC found escalating levels of fraud and cyber-attacks in the financial services sector; 44% of firms questioned said they had experienced customer fraud in the past two years, and 38% had experienced cyber-crime. Firms must balance stringent checks and compliance requirements with customers’ demands for a rapid, seamless experience. While criminals are becoming increasingly inventive, innovative technology is a powerful tool that is helping institutions manage fraud and security risk without impacting the customer journey. Machine learning and AI algorithms allow for the near-instantaneous analysis of vast amounts of transactional data, including a customer’s financial history and behavior, to rapidly detect anomalies and identify potential security threats. Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and voice recognition are adding an extra layer of security. Fintech for fluid environments These are just some of the trends transforming the financial services sector. We are experts in navigating this complex landscape, helping clients make difficult choices that have a meaningful impact and create a better customer experience. We have helped many players in the financial services industry transform and future-proof their organization. From consolidating monitoring tools to allow them to identify security threats more easily to implementing real-time notifications and continuous testing to ensure ongoing improvement of systems and processes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 INTRODUCTION 7 CHALLENGES TO THE CONTINUITY OF THE STATE 11 POLICIES FOR BUILDING RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES 14 Adopt a digital-first approach to critical public services and registries 17 Transition to remote-first and remote-enabled public sector jobs 20 Secure digital public infrastructure and services 22 Ensure widespread affordable access and redundancy to connectivity 24 Build redundancy to digital public infrastructure 26 Manage the third-party risk while preserving technological innovation 29 Create institutional capacity for developing government resilience 32 THE FUTURE OF RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES 34 BIBLIOGRAPHY 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS 4 Today’s world is a digital one. States that want to remain relevant must digitalize, or they will be left behind. This is not a new phenomenon but has been unfolding for more than three decades. Following the global proliferation of the internet in the 1990s, there has been international interest in harnessing the power of technology to transform the way states operate. In the years to come, many states worldwide invested heavily in new initiatives focused on digitalizing their critical data assets or bringing traditionally paper-based services into new digital formats. States that made a more substantial commitment to digitalization are benefitting from it today, often seeing an increase in the overall effectiveness of their public sector. These states will have an advantage over their geopolitical rivals in the emerging digital world order. For states that did not digitalize or view it as a priority early on, recent crises have forced policymakers to realize the necessity of digital technologies for running a state in the 21st century. States are currently navigating a time defined by multiple crises, a polycrisis. COVID-19 brought the physical world to a standstill for much of 2020. As a result, many governments could not operate or deliver many of their services. Climate change is also becoming increasingly disruptive for governments as natural disasters grow in number and severity. Some states may experience worsening wildfires; others may see an increase in the scale of flooding; some countries like Tuvalu may even face the loss of their physical territory. Conflict is on the rise, as demonstrated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and a growth in tension between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Democratic states are also facing an increase in internal crises; for example, new challenges are emerging due to democratic backsliding, declining voter turnout, and dissatisfaction with democracy more broadly. States are being forced to manage numerous ongoing crises at any given time, both domestically and internationally, in addition to their other critical responsibilities. Usually, states must do this with a public sector facing a shrinking budget, workforce, and ever-growing demands for efficiency and effectiveness. The only way to navigate these challenges successfully is by embracing the potential of digital technologies. This is what the world has seen. Digital states were better able to manage the COVID-19 pandemic than those that were not. Digital technologies also play a key role in monitoring, managing, or curtailing the impact of natural disasters. In conflict, states that can better leverage digital technologies, especially those that enable connectivity and data-driven decision-making, will have the advantage. Thus, the world is witnessing the rise of new digital states where digital technologies and data are core to the functioning of the state itself. However, as a result, these states introduce new dependences on technology. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 This is not something that should be feared, but it is something that should be respected. It is of the utmost importance that when states embark on their path toward digitalization, they prioritize the long-term resilience of the digital infrastructure that they are building. This report was written to help guide policymakers interested in building and developing better, stronger, and more robust digital states. To do this, the report provides an overview of key progress made in creating government resilience in the digital age, and through this also the history of the current digital world order. Following this, the report adopts a scenario-based approach to illustrate the sorts of crises that states must prepare their digital infrastructure for. Drawing on the insights of this scenario, the report introduces seven key policy recommendations intended to help build and strengthen the resilience of a state’s digital infrastructure. Æ First, states must adopt a digital- first approach to public services and registries related to the continuity of the state. Æ Second, states must start enabling the transition to public sector jobs that can operate in a remote-first or remote-enabled manner. Æ Third, states must prioritize the security of their digital infrastructure and services. Æ Fourth, states must ensure resilience in connectivity by viewing internet access as critical infrastructure. Æ Fifth, states must improve their resilience by reducing opportunities for physical damage to disrupt their digital operations. Æ Sixth, states must invest in the ability to manage third-party risk without limiting opportunities for technological innovation. Æ Seventh, governments must adopt a whole-of-government approach to developing digital resilience. States that adopt the above recommendations when building their digital infrastructure, accompanied by the necessary organizational and policy changes, will be rewarded with a resilient digital state. If built properly, a sufficiently resilient digital state could run its core and critical digital services even if there was a temporary or more long- term loss of its physical territory due to a crisis. This is something that is now only possible due to technology. It also represents the need to shift how we think about states in this new digital world where digital is no longer tied to the physical boundaries of a nation. 6 The future of democracy is digital. During the pandemic nearly 30% of governments in Europe postponed elections between 2020–2022 [10], which arguably damaged their democratic process. Digital state processes have become a necessity to better protect our states during crises. 7 INTRODUCTION In the aftermath of the Second World War, the global community developed the foundations for a new geopolitical order aligned with liberal values. The number of democratically aligned states began to grow during the same period; democracy represented hope and a vision of a better future. Following the defeat and dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, optimism continued to grow. For the first time in history, most of the world’s population lived in states defined by liberal and democratic values [1]. During this period of democratization, another foundation of today’s world came to the forefront – the internet. The internet and its global spread transformed the way the world communicated and bolstered support for the values of liberty, democracy, and freedom. In a 1994 speech, Vice President Al Gore hoped that “Central and Eastern Europe can use technology and the free market to build democracy – not thwart it. [2]” Several months later, he echoed these sentiments and his belief in the positive potential of the internet to “derive robust and sustainable economic progress, strong democracies, [and] better solutions to global and local environmental challenges. [3]” It was clear that technology, especially the internet, could transform the world’s thoughts about states and governments. Though many states started experimenting with technology to reimagine their governments, not all were fully committed or successful. Some states also saw technology as posing a potential threat to the state. It was argued that if the computerization of society could “alter the entire nervous system of social organization,” then these developments would “change the stakes of sovereignty” [4] as private sector companies came to challenge the state’s control over communications. In contrast, Estonia, which restored its independence in 1991, stands out as one of the few countries that fully embraced technology early on. Estonia’s first information development plan, “The Estonian Road to an Information Society”, was released in 1994 and argued that technology would play a vital role in the future of states, improving their efficiency and helping to strengthen and secure their culture, sovereignty, and security. Importantly, this strategy also saw the private sector not as a barrier or a challenge to the state but a key component in helping the government achieve its digitalization goal. Now, more than three decades later, it is possible to look back and reflect on these early beliefs about the liberal geopolitical order, democracy, states, governments, technology, and the relationship between them. What emerges is an image of a new 8 digital world. In this new world, however, democratic states are being challenged by democratic backsliding [5], declining voter turnout [6], and increasing dissatisfaction amongst voters [7] are beginning to weaken. While fighting to maintain their democratic systems of government and pushing back the growing global influence of authoritarianism [8], democratic states also face unprecedented external challenges to their stability and safety. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caught many off guard and exposed numerous weaknesses in government operations. However, the pandemic also showed that states that could leverage data and technology more effectively performed better [9]. During the pandemic nearly 30% of governments in Europe postponed elections between 2020–2022 [10], which arguably damaged their democratic process. Even fewer states were able to seamlessly transition to remote schooling, damaging the education and learning of children. Climate change, too, is making itself increasingly known, with natural disasters becoming increasingly common and growing in severity and intensity. For some states, this means bearing the brunt of powerful floods, hurricanes, or fires for others, they are facing a future where their entire physical territory will disappear within their lifetime [11]. If before it was possible to ignore the benefits and positive potential of digitalization for states, today, this is no longer the case. States that do not digitalize will be left behind, increasingly vulnerable in a world defined by technology. Technology must be viewed as an essential and integral component of the state to overcome and address the world’s growing complexity today. Many states now realise this and are investing large amounts of resources into digitalization. The European Union alone has budgeted more than €100 billion to help support the development of a digital and resilient Europe [12]. Digitalization will improve how effective and efficient states run, but it also brings new challenges and threats. Many states cannot independently develop, build, or sustain the digital infrastructure and technologies they require and have engaged heavily with private sector technology companies [13]. This growing reliance on the private sector has led policymakers and academics to argue that there is an ongoing “coup,” [14] where technology companies have begun to overtake and consume the state. These fears are even stronger when the companies relied upon are based within foreign states. There has been growing interest in policies supporting “digital sovereignty” and “data sovereignty” [15] to counteract these fears. Though such concerns are understandable, by tying digital infrastructure to the physical territory of a specific country new vulnerabilities are created. Similarly, by trying to reduce the power or strength of the largest technology industry the ability of the state to defend itself in the cyber domain is also weakened. Yet, peace no longer exists in the digital world, and digital infrastructure is a clear target. The private sector plays a critical role in helping to defend states against robust, consistent, and comprehensive cyber threats from hostile nations daily [16]. These threats are real. In 2007, Estonia was targeted by a large cyber-attack significantly disrupted the country’s normal operations. In the current war in Ukraine, Russia utilised both digital and physical means to disrupt Ukraine’s ability to operate digitally targeting 9 key data centres with both malware and cruise missiles [17]. With military tensions continuing to rise between Taiwan and China, many have argued that China’s first steps are likely to target Taiwan’s critical digital infrastructure [18]. As threats to the physical territory of liberal and democratically aligned states continue to grow from conflict and other factors, it is important to think through how to build more robust and resilient digital states. Building and investing in a better, stronger, and more resilient digital future will not only help ensure the longevity of democratic states themselves, but also provide them with new opportunities to sell their vision of a new digital geopolitical order. This report represents a first step in this process, challenging the existing conceptualisation of what it means to be a state in today’s digital age. To aid this conceptual exercise, the report identifies several scenarios states may encounter in the decades ahead and explores how digital technologies could be used to overcome them. Following this exploration, the report identifies and offers several key policies and building blocks for constructing more robust and resilient digital states. 10 11 CHALLENGES TO THE CONTINUITY OF THE STATE Crises and natural disasters have always been a part of our world. Whether they are the result of political, economic, social, or environmental factors, crises often share common characteristics that result in widespread disruption to societies and individuals. Historically, crises have often played a pivotal role in influencing the fate of a state. History is full of examples that demonstrate how states, when unable to overcome the challenges posed by a crisis, decline in power and influence or in some cases even cease to exist [19]. While the root causes of many crises remain similar today as they were centuries ago, for example when confronting a large natural disaster, war, or a pandemic, the world of today is more interconnected than ever before. As a result, the difficulty of addressing a crisis has rapidly increased in complexity and its potential impact is larger in scale. Due to the digital and integrated nature of the world, states are dependent on global supply chains, resources, and technology [20]. Recent examples of this include the COVID-19 pandemic which caused global supply chain disruption that continues to this day [21], the WannaCry ransomware attack, and the War in Ukraine. Importantly, as today’s world is digital, it is no longer possible to separate the physical and the virtual worlds. In each of the above examples significant impact was felt in both realms at the same time. Today, the destruction of the virtual environment or critical datasets can cause more harm than the destruction of a building or physical infrastructure. During times of conflict, which is also becoming increasingly digital, denying your adversary’s access to cyberspace and digital services could bring the functioning of the state to a halt. While increasing levels of digitalization and technological innovation create new vulnerabilities for states, they also provide the means to make societies more resilient than ever before. Through technological development and strategic, comprehensive, digitalization of society it is possible for states to increase their resilience by reducing their dependence on the physical realm. In the next chapter the report examines in more detail what policies can be implemented to make government more resilient in the digital age. 12 WHAT IS THE THREAT? EXAMPLE UNMITIGATED CRISIS SCENARIO Natural disasters, climate change, or military conflicts have resulted in significant disruptions to the standard operations of national services, causing them to be limited or, in certain instances, entirely non- operational. The immediate aftermath of these disasters reveals a grim scenario where critical infrastructure has sustained extensive physical degradation. Numerous domestic data centres have been destroyed, leaving a significant portion of the national digital backbone inoperable. The reliability of electricity has become erratic, and the continuity of fuel supply is compromised. Furthermore, the local telecommunications infrastructure has been critically damaged, impeding effective communication. In parallel, cyberattacks or the destruction of digital infrastructure may also occur, rendering some services permanently or temporarily unavailable. The interdependencies between registries and services can lead to cascading effects, causing an increasing number of services across different sectors to become unavailable. In such cases, alternative operating procedures shall be activated. As a result, the continuous operation of digital services has been severely restricted, making it almost impossible to maintain the modern way of living. The dependencies among registries, various information systems, and underlying national services, such as electronic identification, have become starkly apparent as some systems fail due to the issues. The nature of the crisis, the extent of the affected physical territory, and the low level of preparedness have collectively contributed to the realization of these risks. In response, some registries (paper or digital) may have been relocated to safer zones, while others remain offline – temporarily or permanently. In the worst case, critical data assets and their backups could be destroyed permanently or irreversibly corrupted, leading to a devastating data loss. The state and the services that rely on these registries are facing significant challenges; a few can function, but others have ceased to operate due to the lack of essential data. This gradual deterioration of public services is having a broader impact on public sentiment and opinion. Access to information is severely constrained, leading to widespread fear and uncertainty among the population. The state now faces the daunting task of ensuring the short-term continuance of governance and providing support to displaced individuals who have managed to seek safety elsewhere. THE START OF THE CRISIS: 13 Due to the ongoing crisis, a significant portion of the physical territory of the state has become uninhabitable. The government is grappling with the challenge of survival, while contemplating the possibility of conducting some operations in exile. In this context, the resilience of the state’s democratic institutions amidst climate change or prolonged conflicts, as well as the long-term preservation of the nation and its cultural heritage, has emerged as a strategic objective. Compelled to function with a diminished number of services, it is imperative that the state can continue to update information about citizens, ownership, cultural heritage, etc., to ensure the continuity of nationhood and facilitate the restoration of the nation following the prolonged crisis. Moreover, citizens still require access to governmental services while in exile. Certain information from national registries will be transferred to foreign registries to facilitate the use of essential services, such as medical and educational data. It is essential that educational resources, such as schoolbooks, and virtual schooling be made available to sustain the language and culture in both the short and long term. Failure to provide such services would eventually lead citizens to lose their connection to their homeland. This gradual erosion of national identity will cause the nation to lose its political and cultural distinctiveness. Consequently, individuals will no longer feel a sense of belonging, ultimately leading to a point where the state’s continuity is compromised and rendered unsustainable under external pressures. CONTINUATION OF THE CRISIS: 14 POLICIES FOR BUILDING RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES In the two previous chapters, the report outlined how digital technologies and a growth in the number and severity of crises increasingly define the world of today. To remain relevant, states must digitalize; this is no longer optional. As the internal functions of the state become increasingly digital, it is essential to ensure their long-term resilience and reliability. This is especially important as states worldwide continue to face multiple, interconnected, and complex crises, from war to pandemics to climate change. Each of these may have a significant impact on the functioning of the state, for example, by disrupting internet connectivity, closing physical offices of public servants, or even causing destruction of data assets critical to the state. As states undergo the transformation into new digital states, it is of the utmost importance to think strategically about how to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure that, even if unlikely in the short-term, have a high probability of occurring in the long-term. Drawing on the potential challenges and side effects that may follow a crisis, such as the one described above, this section outlines seven recommendations to increase the digital resilience of the state. These recommendations, if adopted, will help to ensure that a digital state can function even when facing the worst of crises. In the worst-case scenario, they would help enable a state to run digitally even if it no longer maintained control over its physical territory. 15 ADOPT A DIGITAL- FIRST APPROACH TO CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND REGISTRIES Digital rather than paper registries and services are more reliable and efficient, especially in crisis situations. Unfortunately, many governments have not digitalized their critical services related to the continuity of the state and the nation. To increase the state’s reliability and resilience the digitalization of such services must be prioritized. TRANSITION TO REMOTE-FIRST AND REMOTE-ENABLED PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS Civil servants that assure the continuity of digital public infrastructure and services are affected by crises just as much as the rest of the population. Enabling public sector jobs to operate completely remotely is necessary for increasing national resilience. 01 02 SECURE THE STATE’S DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES Successfully denying access to, or tampering with, critical digital data, services, and registries is essential to ensuring the legitimacy of a digital state. Establishing mandatory security standards and requirements for public services and infrastructure from both internal and external threats provides the means to increase the long-term cyber resilience of the state. ENSURE WIDESPREAD AFFORDABLE ACCESS AND REDUNDANCY TO CONNECTIVITY In today’s digital age, access to the internet is becoming as crucial as access to other infrastructure and amenities. The state must explore all technology options available for ensuring resilience. 03 04 16 BUILD REDUNDANCY- POTENTIALLY BEYOND TERRITORIAL BORDERS- TO DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES States must guarantee that digital public services and infrastructure are safeguarded against physical destruction resulting from the operation of these digital services within a limited physical space. This may involve positioning at least part of the infrastructure beyond their own territorial borders. In doing so, governments must also resolve issues on mutual trust to be capable of providing a safe harbour for digital governments on foreign territory. MANAGE THIRD- PARTY RISK WHILE PRESERVING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION Almost all digital public services and infrastructure contain technological “black boxes” not properly auditable, transparent, and may even challenge the digital sovereignty of the state. As the world continues to digitalize this trend will continue. Procedures should be established to mitigate this risk to a reasonable level that does not severely inhibit innovation, avoiding over-regulation. 05 06 CREATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE Government resilience involves decentralized responsibility for each government function, but to avoid cascading failures, a coordinated top-down approach is also needed. The appointment of a centralized body is recommended to oversee and ensure the execution of policies aimed at increasing resilience and continuity across all government levels. 07 17 01 ADOPT A DIGITAL-FIRST APPROACH TO CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND REGISTRIES A key component for any digital state will be the development and maintenance of digital registries. These registries are responsible for maintaining up-to-date information on all aspects of the state, from registering births to managing real estate ownership. For such a system to work effectively, states rely on the public’s trust in government institutions as well as a system of justice that fairly protects a citizen’s rights. In the digital age, ownership is mostly defined by data in digital registries and various systems distributed across public and private sector. The ownership of all significant things – parenthood, property, education, inheritance, even medical history, shares, wealth – is inherently digital. In such a system, digital data and information would take precedent over physical alternatives – this is the most efficient and resilient way to govern today. Today, most modern governments have some form of digital registries and online services, but the transformation is usually partial at best. For example, some states may allow for people to apply online for a driving license, but they likely must collect the document physically at a government building. This is a problem that can be solved with technology; the limitations to broader digitalization are almost always related directly to legacy procedures, legal frameworks, or a lack of trust. It is for this reason why digital states must not stop only at investing in technology but must rethink their internal processes and operations by adopting a digital-first approach to the public sector. The digital registries, services, information, and assets critical to the continuity of the state must be made accessible from anywhere (i.e., digital) and provide end-to-end outcomes. Getting this right will require states to understand which registries, services, and assets should be viewed as “critical” for the long-term resilience of the digital state. Four especially relevant categories are presented below, which can be further categorized by their relevance to continuity of the state and their relevance to ensuring the flow of critical public services. 18 1. State governance. Services within this category include elections and voting, registry of laws and regulations, state decisions, strategic communications and state announcements. During a long-term crisis, such as a war, are likely to have a significant impact on this category. 2. Registries of ownership, obligations and justice. This category includes the most important registries: the population registry, business registry, property registers (cadastre, vehicles etc.), taxes, criminal records and other legal facts. 3. Citizen services. This category includes services such as getting new passport and identity documents, obtaining internationally recognized licenses and certificates (e.g. of education), receiving social benefits, and paying taxes. It also includes services related to the preservation of the national identity, such as access to the national archive, public broadcasting archive, national literature, and educational materials and assets to continue schooling. 4. International integrations with neighbours. This category is related to services that enable cross-border information exchange. These services are especially useful if a crisis is accompanied by the mass movement of people into new territory, for example by providing them with a form of digital identity that can be easily exported. For services managed or owned by third parties (e.g., private sector entities), a mechanism could be introduced to incentivize digital development. For instance, when procuring educational books for children, digital versions should also be required. Unlike physical books, which can be damaged or become inaccessible, digital copies can be widely distributed and remain accessible, proving especially valuable in times of crisis. 19 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Identify which services and registries are critical for the long-term continuity of both the state and the nation in various state of emergency scenarios. Æ Implement a policy that requires the digital transformation of public services deemed vital for the state’s long-term continuity. Æ Adopt a policy that prioritizes the development of digital-first services and assets, ensuring compliance with established security standards and requirements. Figure: Government mobile services can provide widespread, accessible and cost-efficient access to public services and documents. And have potential of taking them also cross-border. 20 02 TRANSITION TO REMOTE-FIRST AND REMOTE-ENABLED PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS Adopting a digital-first approach to public service delivery will help to free up human resources as services become more efficient, automatic, or proactive but there will still be a need for public servants to ensure that systems remain operational and secure. For public servants working with critical services, during a time of crisis it is even more important that they can do their job. However, it is also likely that they too will be impacted during a crisis or state of emergency and their ability to operate from a physical office may not be possible. The solution is to enable public sector workers connected to the operation of critical services the ability to work fully remotely. There are three primary considerations to consider when adopting a remote-first approach to the public sector workforce: 1. The transition of work to secure digital channels. 2. Ensure the internal systems, software and infrastructure are universally available and accessible remotely. 3. The establishment of new, remote- friendly digital internal decision-making, leadership, processes, and audit trails. These changes are hard to do but are also a key component of ensuring the long-term resilience of the digital state. Usually, digitalizing a service or its infrastructure is the easiest part of the solution. Instead, the hardest aspect is transforming the organization itself, its decision- making processes, and its culture. Often organizations rely on paper or some key assets that can only be accessed locally, limiting opportunities for change and remote operations. To overcome this challenge, it is possible to develop a model that differentiates between “remote-first” and “remote-enabled” jobs in the public sector. Remote-first jobs are those where it would be mandatory to be capable of working long-term remotely, with all organizational processes and systems supporting this. Remote-enabled jobs are those that could be required to work remotely under specific constraints, such as having flexibility toward the equipment needs and physical workplace. It is not enough to have remote workforce policies or strategies in place, but these changes must be followed. By enabling remote operations of the digital state de- facto, it will help to build resilience in the event of a disruptive crisis. This readiness can be further increased by running crisis exercises. These exercises involve creating a controlled environment for simulating the conditions of a crisis, testing whether the developed remote working operations operate as anticipated. 21 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Identify public authorities and positions related to critical services for the continuity of the state and develop a categorization for jobs that should be remote-first or remote-enabled. Æ Identify infrastructure and systems not accessible from a remote-first perspective. Æ Establish a long-term IT and organizational strategy to shift to remote-first and remote- enabled jobs. Æ Create an independent unit responsible for assessing organizational barriers to the remote- first transition and running annual or quarterly exercises that test an organization’s ability to operate under remote working conditions. 22 03 SECURE DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES In the digital age, the notion of conflict has changed. Cyberattacks are a daily occurrence and an unavoidable part of the world’s new digital reality. As states continue to digitalize, it is essential that cyber security and the protection of digital infrastructure is made a priority. Estonia has been on both sides of this new reality. In 2007, Estonia suffered one of the first national scale cyberattacks in the world. As a result, Estonia implemented new laws and regulations, developed standards, and devoted large amounts of resources into improving their cyber defense capabilities. In the years that have passed, Estonia has managed to successfully defend against numerous massive cyberattacks without significant disruption to its digital society. In most cases, Estonian residents do not even know such events have taken place. However, this threat will always be present. As much of a state’s critical infrastructure has become digital – even physical infrastructure, such as power plants or hospitals – cyber defense must be a national priority. Over the past decades, it has become increasingly clear that while it is possible to build walls around systems, and strongly defend them, if an attacker is significantly resourced and motivated, they will find a way to infiltrate their target’s systems. As there is no peace in cyberspace, these digital systems must always be built from the perspective of wartime resilience. Investments in cybersecurity cannot be made post-factum they must be implemented from inception. Ultimately, the long-term best practice is to develop a set of principles for the digital state that (when complied with) significantly increase the cost and time for an attack to be successful. Additionally, as threats are constantly evolving, the countermeasures must too. Digital states must assess and leverage modern solutions and tools to actively monitor, analyze, and respond to cyber incidents, including the use of cloud-based threat intelligence, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for pattern recognition. Gathered threat intelligence must be shared real-time through collaborative platforms across the state and internationally by like-minded nations to enhance its ability to respond and coordinate effectively. In addition to external threats, countries must also secure the digital state from internal threats. Data integrity must be made a priority so that not even the people guarding or maintaining data for the state are able to change it without a trace being left. The Estonian government started using technologies such as blockchain to assure critical registries cannot be tampered with [22]. Getting this ecosystem right, with cybersecurity at the forefront, will require a digital state to build up its national and institutional cyber capabilities. By creating a community of collaboration between regulators, service providers, research organizations, universities, and companies it is possible to help develop this expertise. 23 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Mandate nationwide adherence to cybersecurity standards and industry best practices while considering nation-wide risk scenarios and enforcing minimum security measures accordingly. Æ Assign a security and criticality classification to information systems and map the cross- dependencies of those systems. Prioritize the continuity of the systems with highest impact. Æ Consolidate the monitoring and analysis of cyber incidents to a centralized body for government wide situational awarenesses and rapid mitigation and response of the incidents. Æ Ensure that there is a sustainable and continuous budget for investment in cybersecurity to reduce the risk in the fast-paced threat environment. Our recommendation is to spend at least 10% of IT-budget to cybersecurity. Æ Enhance national and institutional capabilities in the domain of cybersecurity. Strengthen collaboration with research institutions and reliable partners to continually refine and update protective standards, thereby effectively addressing emerging and future threats. Æ Appoint an organization that is responsible for cybersecurity within the country with executive power for all abovementioned points. 24 04 ENSURE WIDESPREAD AFFORDABLE ACCESS AND REDUNDANCY TO CONNECTIVITY Any loss of connectivity during a crisis implies that people are effectively cut off from the state and its services. In today’s digital age, access to the internet is as crucial for people as access to basic infrastructure and amenities. Several countries – such as Finland and Estonia – have implemented policies that declare connectivity as a basic infrastructure need (or even as a human right) and having declared it a national priority to provide every citizen with broadband access. These countries also show good correlation between connectivity and general level of digitalization. Connectivity must, therefore, be both widespread and resilient, resistant to tampering and adversarial interference. States must aim to improve access and coverage to the internet across their territory and, where possible, create free public access points such as in schools, libraries, and other key locations. Free market and competition should be assured to lower the cost of connectivity and increase the number of options. Countries can create incentives, subsidies, tax exceptions, license-free breaks, etc., for new telecommunications companies entering the local market to increase competition. With widespread and affordable broadband, states can even consider providing a limited free 4G/5G option that can only be utilized to access select services (news, public services, etc.), with the rationale of shifting costs from helpdesks and front offices to digital services. Building redundancy in connectivity is critical to assure resilience in crisis situations. During times of conflict, the infrastructure of the internet itself may be called into question, and undersea cables are vulnerable to sabotage and destruction. States must consider this and invest, where possible, into new and emerging communication technologies. For example, this may include adopting satellite communication programs that help overcome disruptions to traditional internet connectivity methods. To further increase resilience during crises, interoperability should be forced to network providers through regulation. Cross-border interoperability further enhances resilience. The state would assure the required agreements between the telecommunication providers. This approach has been best exemplified by Ukraine. Shortly days after the Russian invasion began in Ukraine in 2022, the country’s three main cellular operators activated a free roaming service between their respective networks [23]. If a user’s mobile network signal becomes unavailable, they are advised to try one of the other two providers. 25 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish a government function (e.g. National Connectivity Board) with direct mandate for: Æ Assure that affordable connectivity options exist for everybody. Consider having connectivity as a form of “human right”. Æ Conduct risk analysis on existing national connectivity options and introduce strategic diversification of connectivity types. Æ Exercise national digital infrastructure continuity in reduced connectivity scenarios. Implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure that critical systems remain operational during network disruptions. Æ Lower the cost of connectivity either through subsidies and incentives for new telecommunication providers or through direct benefits to end-users. Æ Create interoperability between telecommunication providers. Figure: undersea cables connect the digital world together, but are also vulnerable to sabotage. States must develop resilience in connectivity through multiple technology options. 26 05 BUILD REDUNDANCY TO DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE The extent to which modern societies rely on digital registries and public digital infrastructure is enormous. Most government databases are digital and, in the case of nations such as Estonia, so are almost all public services. Destruction or hostile control of just a few key critical registries or infrastructure facilities hosting them could send a government into turmoil. A key weakness of digital states is that, fundamentally, their digital data and assets are based on territory in the physical world. If the location of these data are known then this location can be damaged or destroyed and if backups are not available this could deny a state the ability to provide critical services. Imagining a severe scenario, the resulting crisis could even damage the perceived legitimacy of the state itself. Additionally, in the case that key digital registries fall into the hands of an adversary, they could severely disrupt the state’s data assets by deleting individuals or companies from registers, changing property rights, or altering the state’s finances. For this reason, several governments have sought to establish a Plan B to prepare for a potentially catastrophic scenario where public data necessary for the state’s continuity and legitimacy can neither be tampered with nor destroyed in any circumstance. One well-known solution for this is the Estonian Data Embassy [24], where key government registries and digital assets are backed up and stored on the territory of another sovereign country. In the case of a catastrophe, the data stored in the Data Embassy can be utilized to restore the legitimate state of governance and assure that tampering has not occurred. When initially conceptualized, this strategy was logical. There were fewer systems, the dependencies were manageable, and the amount of data was significantly lower. More importantly, however, the perception of threat was short-term. It was assumed that a crisis would last a short time – days, weeks, or months perhaps, but not years. It is now clear that this thinking was optimistic. Today, digital systems are highly interconnected and complex, and any long- term solution would need to be capable of not only backing up data and systems to a sovereign territory but also operating them from there (or at least from other locations in the country). Instead of a state-wide archiving solution, it is even more important to develop a Digital Embassy. This solution would allow for the duplication of a sovereign cloud onto foreign territory and, if necessary, allow for a foreign digital state to operate its digital services from it. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the practical need for such a solution. When Kyiv was partially encircled in 2022, it became evident that Ukraine would face a dire situation if it lost access to is key digital 27 registries. Following the Estonian Data Embassy model, efforts were made to break out of the capital and move entire data centres into friendly countries for safekeeping and backup operations [25]. Soon, large cloud providers also followed, and by today it can be said that Ukraine’s digital continuity is assured by NATO countries and companies operating in NATO territories. This transition toward building a resilient and dynamic cloud environment will not be an easy task. States should start by prioritizing the transition to local or international clouds for critical public services and infrastructure first. This change will require broad legislative and regulatory support, from removing obstacles in the existing legislation to creating capabilities, particularly in terms of international cooperation. Figure: Integrations and data exchange of government systems in Estonia. Without a holistic approach to resilience, a single failing critical system could create a propagating cascading failure. 28 Figure: Phased transition to wider international alliances based on mutual trust and agreements. The locations on the map are for illustrative purposes only. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Establish national information system standards that mandates critical public services and infrastructure to become cloud-compatible over a specific time span. The standard shall establish mandatory requirements for all government system procurements and internal developments. Æ Assess the existing critical public services and infrastructure to identify gaps blocking the transition. Æ Work with multinational partners and regulators on assuring control and trust over cloud services. Æ Establish a national body (such as National Cloud Governance Centre) which would act as a single point of resource for cloud infrastructure, managing the market research, risk management, procurement, adoption, interoperability and minimum-security requirements for the entire government and providing incentives for all authorities for the transition. 29 06 MANAGE THE THIRD-PARTY RISK WHILE PRESERVING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION As the digital world is both globalizing and consolidating, third-party risk management is becoming a strategically critical capability. As much of the world’s technology stack relies on third-party components, a compromise to any part of the supply or dependency chain can cause significant damage. Only by assuring the safety and compliance of the entire chain in its depth, could the results be deemed safe. One recent example of a successful supply chain attack was the compromise of SolarWinds, significantly impacting the national security of the United States [26]. Managing third-party risk is hard, and it will get harder. It will require states to be able to make strategic choices about the software and hardware they procure and also develop the capability to have a constant awareness of the current state of the digital global supply chain. While the security and compliance of a limited number of hardware and software products can be assessed to be safe, assuring compliance for all public digital services and infrastructure development and its dependencies in full risk depth is likely too much for any regulator. Depending on a state and its position toward the global community, they might address these challenges differently. For example, a weighted-risk approach could be chosen where a risk-tolerant strategy could be followed, dependent on the criticality of the subject service. This approach would ensure that critical systems would receive proportionately higher compliance requirements, whereas non-critical systems could either be audited at a lower level or require only voluntary compliance. However, not all risks can be fully mitigated. Most states are dependent on foreign technologies that have little or no alternatives. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is one example of a cornerstone technology for many modern services with limited competition and low adoption of these alternatives. While larger states may be able to develop their own operating systems, they will almost always rely on third- party components, and even then, it would almost certainly not be a cost-effective use of resources. Instead, regulators are now working to develop long-term SLAs that force compliance with domestic requirements. 30 In the broader sense, the key challenge to third-party risk management lies in finding the balance between openness and fostering innovation with regulation and ensuring risk mitigation. To counter the risk of limiting innovation, a risk-tolerant fallback strategy should be utilized. For example, AI tools are mostly cloud-based and incorporating them into a digital state’s operations could potentially create a “black box” dependency. However, following a risk-tolerant approach, instead of banning the external dependency from the service, it could instead be introduced as a switchable feature, which could be turned off at any point. This might downgrade the service experience for the end-user, but it would ultimately not cause the service to fail entirely in case of interruptions with dependencies. 31 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Æ Establish a nationwide risk management policy to manage third-party risks. This policy shall establish rules on which systems can or cannot use what kind of proprietary technologies and if a more comprehensive system must be capable of operating in an emergency mode also independently of said technologies. These rules shall be minimal enough to be practical, implementable, and easily auditable. Æ Enforce the policy and rules for third-party risk management of most common technology and security standards through a central authority. This central authority shall build the capability to monitor and react to changes in the supply chain and find optimal cost-to-risk ratio alternatives. Æ Establish an audit authority for critical public services and infrastructure to comply with the established policy. Æ Exercise the resilience to third-party risks while testing and auditing relevant aspects in the policy. Æ Work with multinational regulators to manage third-party risk globally and share the knowledge with partners in like-minded nations. 32 07 CREATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE Government resilience and plans for the continuity of the state are broad concepts, involving in some ways most if not all functions of the government. Considering scalability, each government function or service should be responsible for their own resilience, creating a de-centralized approach to resilience. This encompasses both specific plans and changes, but also broader increase in the maturity across several disciplines required for the operation of digital services. A recommended approach is to appoint a dedicated advisor in government organizations to develop resilience plans and coordinate with other government bodies and private sector partners. However, to mitigate the risks of cascading failures, and managing the practical reality of coordinating with large number government authorities, an additional top-down approach is recommended. To see a whole- of-government policy through execution, typically requires creation of a vertical that has necessary executive power and long-term commitment. For that end, we recommend governments establishment of a vertical body that is responsible for overseeing, coordinating and achieving outcomes that directly relate to increasing government resilience and continuity of the state. That unit should be well-placed in the government power structure to be effective in execution, for example under the State Secretary Office or a similar centralized function. The unit would be responsible for: 1. Owning end-to-end crisis plans across all government. 2. Analysing cross-dependencies for cascade failures and eliminating them. 3. Running government resilience exercises and auditing government organizations for their resilience. 4. Building crisis management competence. 5. Executing crisis management coordination during a crisis with vertical power structure. 6. Policy analysis and coordinating necessary regulative changes. 33 EXAMPLE OF A GOVERNMENT RESILIENCE EXERCISE. Æ In an example scenario of a State Announcements Service, all employees are forced to work remotely. The building is sealed off and powered down, simulating a severe crisis scenario. At the same time, an artificial peak of service load is created, simulating people who are now accessing the service due to the nature of the crisis. To make matters both worse and realistic, the service is also under an extreme cyberattack, further denying access. In an ideal but also achievable outcome, there are minimal to no service interruptions for the citizen. 34 The future resilient digital state utilizes the digital domain to ensure its continuity. It is fully digitalized and demonstrates geographical location independence for its core digital services. How a specific state achieves this goal will depend on their respective context but will certainly involve positioning at least part of their core digital infrastructure outside of their territorial border. It also places significant demands on the state’s capabilities, as ensuring digital operations requires a level of maturity and coordination likely higher than currently exists. The above recommendations are offered from the perspective of developing increasingly resilient digital states. However, these recommendations should not only be viewed from a lens of helping states overcome crises. Instead, they can also be understood as an acknowledgement of the future trajectory that the world is facing. Emerging digital technologies are reshaping our world and the way that we exist within it, states are not immune from this change. Failing to digitalize, states will not be able to effectively manage the growing number and complexity of crises they will face in the years ahead. As digital and emerging technologies like AI continue to reshape our world, states must also show their willingness to adapt. THE FUTURE OF RESILIENT DIGITAL STATES 35 Key to this adaptation will be a state’s ability to integrate digital technology into their understanding of the state itself. There is also substantial opportunity for the international community to update the way in which they think about emergent digital states. What might it look like if a state loses sovereignty over its territory due to conflict, or if its territory disappears due to a natural disaster or another crisis? What would it mean if a state was able to maintain its public services, national identity, and democratic system of government via virtual means? These digital states represent a potential future where governance, culture, and community are not necessarily defined only by the territory where an individual is born but by their participation and contribution in the digital realm as well. This is not an abstract thought experiment, but a call to action to the international community to take this issue seriously. These are issues that the world will have to confront in the near term as some states are already on track to watch their physical territory disappear due to rising sea levels. This is just one example, but there are many more and they are likely to continue to occur in the years ahead. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. D.

The convergence of Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT), and nascent Artificial Intelligence (AI) has unlocked unprecedented efficiencies in port operations. However, this hyper-connectivity has also exposed the industry to a new and perilous tide of sophisticated cyber threats. These threats are no longer confined to data theft; they now pose a direct risk of operational paralysis, physical sabotage, and systemic supply chain disruption that can ripple across the globe. The stakes have never been higher. A single, well- executed cyber incident can bring a major port to a standstill, incurring costs that can reach millions of dollars per day and triggering cascading failures throughout the international supply chain. The 2017 NotPetya malware attack, which inflicted losses exceeding nearly €175 million against shipping giant Maersk, served as a watershed moment for the industry. Yet, recent incidents and escalating geopolitical tensions demonstrate that the threat has only intensified. A 2023 report by HFW and CyberOwl revealed that the average ransom payment demanded in the maritime sector has soared to €2.76 million, with the total cost of an attack averaging €473,790. In response, a new wave of regulations is moving from guidance to mandate, fundamentally altering the risk landscape for port operators and their executive leadership. The European Union’s updated Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) and the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements (UR E26/E27) for new vessels impose stringent technical and procedural security measures. Critically, these regulations introduce direct accountability for senior management, with non-compliance penalties reaching as high as €10 million or 2 % of a company’s global annual turnover. Navigating the digital current: Building cyber resilience in the ports of tomorrow 4 This report moves beyond a simple enumeration of threats to present an integrated, three-pillar strategic framework for achieving maritime cyber resilience. It argues that a modern, defensible posture must be built upon: Resilient by Design architecture: Adopting a Zero Trust security philosophy to secure the converged IT/OT environment, guided, but not limited by proven industrial frameworks like the Purdue model for network segmentation and IEC 62443 for risk-based controls. Defensible supply chains: Proactively managing the significant risks introduced by third-party vendors, software suppliers, and the vast ecosystem of connected hardware, from cranes to IoT sensors. A culture of active defence: Embedding cybersecurity into the organisation’s DNA through engaged executive governance, advanced and continuous workforce training, and the development of OT-specific incident response capabilities. Cybersecurity is no longer a back-office IT function or a mere cost centre; it is a core component of operational infrastructure and a crucial element of business continuity. For port leadership, it represents both a significant risk to be managed and an opportunity to build a competitive advantage through enhanced reliability and trust. This report provides an actionable roadmap for navigating this complex new reality, guiding the maritime industry from a state of reactive risk to one of strategic, verifiable resilience. 5 The new tide of risk: The hyper-connected maritime ecosystem The modern port is a marvel of logistical efficiency, a hyper-connected ecosystem where the digital and physical worlds converge. This transformation, while essential for global trade, has fundamentally altered the sector’s risk profile. The traditional, siloed view of security is obsolete, replaced by a complex, blended threat landscape where a single digital vulnerability can trigger a cascade of physical and financial consequences. Understanding this new reality—the interconnected nature of port technology, the motivations of those who target it, and the staggering financial and operational costs of failure is the first step toward building genuine resilience. The digital port: An ecosystem of interconnected risk Today’s port environment is a complex “system of systems.” Corporate Information Technology (IT) networks, which manage logistics platforms, scheduling, and financial transactions, are now deeply integrated with Operational Technology (OT) systems, the industrial control systems (ICS), SCADA platforms, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that command the physical world of cranes, gates, and fuel pumps. This convergence is further complicated by the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and/or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices and sensors, and the nascent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for optimising schedules and enabling autonomous vehicles. This drive for efficiency has created a seamless flow of data, but it has also erased the traditional air gaps and security perimeters that once isolated critical operational machinery from the outside world. The attack surface has expanded exponentially, creating countless new entry points for adversaries. The U.S. Coast Guard’s 2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) report starkly illustrates this new reality, noting that advances in satellite communications have forged direct links between shipboard systems and corporate networks. This connectivity enables malware to spread rapidly from a compromised shore-based office to vessels at sea, turning a corporate IT issue into a critical maritime safety incident. The digital port is no longer a collection of discrete systems; it is a single, interconnected ecosystem of efficiency, risk and opportunity. 5 6 The motivations for attacking this critical infrastructure are as diverse as the actors themselves. Port operators face a multi-faceted threat landscape composed of distinct but often overlapping groups: State-sponsored groups: • Nations leverage cyber capabilities as an instrument of power. Groups such as Russia’s APT28 (Fancy Bear) and Sandworm, China’s APT40, and Iran’s Imperial Kitten target maritime infrastructure for geopolitical disruption, economic espionage, and the theft of sensitive intellectual property, such as advanced port and naval technology, to support their own military and economic ambitions. Hacktivist groups: • Ideologically or politically motivated groups like the pro-Russian Killnet and Noname057 use less sophisticated but highly disruptive tactics, primarily distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Their goal is not financial gain but to make a political statement, disrupt the operations of perceived adversaries, and garner media attention. Attacks on European ports have been explicitly linked to efforts to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Cybercriminal organisations: • These financially motivated syndicates, including notorious ransomware gangs like LockBit and CLOP, view ports as high-value targets. They understand that operational downtime is immensely costly, creating powerful leverage for extortion. By encrypting critical systems or stealing and threatening to leak sensitive data, they paralyse operations and force organisations into making multi-million-dollar ransom payments. A critical point of understanding for port leadership is that these categories are not mutually exclusive. The lines between state-sponsored activity and cybercrime are increasingly blurred, creating a more complex and dangerous threat environment. A seemingly standard ransomware attack from a criminal group could, in fact, be a state-sponsored operation designed to probe defences, cause disruption, or create a persistent backdoor for future espionage, all under the guise of a simple shakedown. Similarly, the disruptive actions of hacktivist groups often align perfectly with the geopolitical objectives of their state benefactors. This potential for a geopolitical-criminal nexus elevates the threat from a purely financial risk to a matter of national and economic security, requiring a far more strategic and robust defensive posture. Who is attacking ports and why? 6 7 The consequences of a successful cyber-attack on a port are not abstract; they are concrete, immediate, and financially devastating. To make sound investment decisions, leadership must grasp the full spectrum of potential costs. Direct financial costs: The most visible costs are the ransoms paid and the expenses for remediation. A 2023 report from HFW and CyberOwl found the average ransom payment in the maritime sector has reached €2.76 million, with the average total cost of an attack, including remediation and initial disruption, hitting €473,790. These figures, however, are dwarfed by the costs of major incidents. The 2017 NotPetya attack, which was not even targeted at Maersk but hit the shipping giant as collateral damage, resulted in losses estimated between €172 million and €258 million. Operational costs of downtime: For a port, time is money on a massive scale. Every hour that cranes are idle, ships are unable to dock, and trucks cannot move cargo translates into direct revenue loss. One large port in the United Kingdom estimated its downtime cost to be €200,000 per hour. Broader industry studies reinforce this, with Gartner estimating the average cost of IT downtime at €4824 per minute, and other reports placing the figure for large enterprises at over €860,00 million per hour. The physical blockage of the Suez canal by the container ship Ever Given in 2021 provides a powerful analogue for the potential impact of a cyber-induced operational shutdown at a critical chokepoint, with estimates of the cost to global trade reaching nearly €8 billion per day. Systemic and uninsurable risk: The interconnected nature of global shipping means that a localised attack can have systemic consequences. A landmark study by the University of Cambridge, modelling a hypothetical “Shen attack,” projected that a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region could trigger an economic loss of €95 billion. Critically, the study concluded that the vast majority of this loss would fall into an insurance gap, highlighting the potential for catastrophic, uninsurable risk that threatens the stability of the entire global economy. Reputational and legal costs: Beyond the immediate financial bleed, a cyber-attack inflicts long-term damage to an organisation’s reputation and can trigger severe legal and regulatory penalties. The 2018 data breach at British Airways, for example, resulted not only in a €23 million fine from regulators but also a potential €2.75 billion class-action settlement and a four-year low in the company’s public reputation score. In an industry built on trust and reliability, such damage can be difficult and costly to repair. The bottom line: Quantifying the crippling cost of an attack 8 Despite the clear and escalating risks, a dangerous perception gap persists within the maritime industry’s leadership. There is a marked disconnect between perceived preparedness and the harsh operational reality. This is not merely a technical issue; it is a strategic blind spot that represents one of the sector’s greatest vulnerabilities. Evidence of this disconnect is compelling. A 2022 survey by law firm Jones Walker found that while an overwhelming 90 % of port and terminal executives felt “very confident” in their overall cybersecurity posture, a staggering 45 % of those same respondents admitted their organisation had suffered a breach within the past year. This confidence is further undermined by investment levels that are starkly misaligned with the scale of the risk. The HFW/CyberOwl report revealed that a third of shipping organisations spend less than €86,000 annually on cybersecurity, a fraction of a single potential ransom payment. This gap extends from strategy to technical understanding. The 2024 USCG CTIME report discovered that more than half of the maritime organisations it assessed held fundamentally inaccurate assumptions about their own network architecture. Many believed their critical OT networks were safely “air-gapped” or isolated from IT networks and the internet. In reality, the assessments frequently proved otherwise, uncovering unrecognised and unmonitored connections that exposed their most critical physical processes to attack. The conclusion is unavoidable: the primary challenge in maritime cybersecurity is not a lack of technology, but a lack of strategic alignment. Overconfidence, underinvestment, and a flawed understanding of the converged IT/OT environment have created a fertile ground for adversaries. To move forward, the industry must close this perception gap and treat cyber resilience not as an IT compliance task, but as a fundamental pillar of strategic risk management and business continuity. The strategic disconnect: Confidence vs. reality 9 per hour is the estimated downtime cost by one large port in UK. € 200k of port and terminal executives when asked for a 2022 survey felt “very confident” in their overall cybersecurity posture while a staggering ... 90 % could be the expected economic loss by a coordinated cyber-attack on just 15 major ports in the Asia-Pacific region. € 95 B of them admitted their organisation suffered a security breach the year before. 45 % 9 10 Anatomy of a port shutdown: A multi-vector threat analysis To build an effective defence, port leadership must understand not just the individual threats they face, but how adversaries combine them into sophisticated, multi-vector campaigns designed to cause maximum disruption. By clustering common threats into three core themes: Exploiting the human element Weaponising digital infrastructure Compromising physical operations We can better appreciate the anatomy of a modern port attack and the cascading nature of cyber risk. 01 02 03 11 The most fortified digital defences can be rendered useless by a single, well-placed click. Attacks targeting the human element remain the most common and effective way for adversaries to gain an initial foothold, as they bypass technical controls by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of human psychology: trust, urgency, and fallibility. This category encompasses two deeply related threat types: phishing and social engineering and insider threats and unauthorised access. The cautionary tale of a port administrator opening a seemingly routine email from a logistics partner is a scenario played out daily across the industry. The branding is flawless, the tone is urgent, and the request seems legitimate. Yet, that single click can unleash malware that cripples cargo tracking systems and brings operations to a halt. According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), the speed of this compromise is alarming: the median time from a user opening a malicious email to clicking a link is just 21 seconds, with data entry occurring only 28 seconds later. In less than a minute, an attacker can be inside the network. Phishing remains the most prevalent entry point for attacks in the maritime sector. Tactics range from mass-produced emails with malicious attachments disguised as invoices to highly targeted “spear-phishing” campaigns that use meticulously researched details to build credibility. These are often paired with social engineering, such as a follow-up phone call from someone convincingly impersonating an IT support technician to acquire login credentials. This vector directly enables the second threat: unauthorised access and insider threats. The 2011 incident in Antwerp, where a drug cartel worked with hackers to infiltrate the port’s IT systems, is a stark example. By sending malware-laced emails to port staff, they harvested credentials that allowed them to track and intercept containers filled with cocaine. The operation was facilitated by complicit insiders who helped maintain access and evade detection. An insider threat is not always malicious; it can be an unintentional act by a negligent employee who falls for a phishing scam or a third-party contractor who is given excessive access privileges. The 2021 cyber-attack against the Port of Houston was reportedly initiated via credentials compromised from a third-party provider, perfectly illustrating the dangerous intersection of human error, insider access, and supply chain risk. The impacts of these human-centric attacks are severe. They can lead to the complete compromise of Port Management Systems and Terminal Operating Systems (TOS), allowing attackers to manipulate cargo records, disrupt logistics, and interfere with operational technology. They result in data breaches of sensitive manifests and financial records, which can be sold or used for corporate espionage. Most dangerously, as the Antwerp case shows, they can turn the port’s own digital systems into a tool for facilitating large-scale physical crime. 01 0 The human element: Exploiting trust to open the gates 12 Once an attacker gains initial access—often through human exploitation—they can begin to weaponise the port’s own digital infrastructure against it. This phase of an attack focuses on escalating access, deploying malicious payloads, and leveraging the port’s reliance on technology to disrupt operations and extort payment. This theme combines the threats of ransomware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and malware and supply chain attacks. Ransomware has surged to become the preeminent financial threat to the maritime industry, involved in an estimated 69 % of cyberattacks on ports between 2011 and 2023. The 2017 NotPetya attack on Maersk, which shut down 17 terminals globally, was a wake-up call, but the threat has since evolved.. Modern ransomware attacks, like the one by the LockBit group that paralysed Japan’s Port of Nagoya in July 2023, now employ a “double extortion” model. Attackers not only encrypt critical systems and demand a cryptocurrency payment for the decryption key, but they also steal vast amounts of sensitive data beforehand. This gives them a second point of leverage: if the ransom is not paid, they threaten to release the stolen data on the dark web. The 2024 Verizon DBIR confirms that ransomware and other extortion techniques now account for roughly one- third of all breaches across industries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks represent a different form of digital weaponisation, focused on paralysis rather than penetration. As described in the scenario of a DDoS assault on a smart port, attackers don’t need to breach a system; they simply overwhelm it with a flood of malicious traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users. This is achieved through various methods, including volumetric floods that saturate network bandwidth, protocol attacks (like SYN floods) that exhaust the connection capacity of firewalls and VPN gateways, and sophisticated application-layer (Layer 7) attacks that target the logic of critical APIs for customs or cargo tracking. In the just-in-time world of port logistics, this forced downtime is damage enough, crippling operations and causing immediate financial backlogs. Malware and supply chain attacks act as a force multiplier for these threats, providing a stealthy and effective delivery mechanism. Instead of a frontal assault, attackers compromise a trusted third party, such as a software vendor or maintenance contractor. Malicious code is hidden within a legitimate software update, or stolen vendor credentials are used to abuse trusted remote access channels. The 2024 Verizon DBIR highlights a 68 % year-over-year increase in breaches involving a third party, often driven by the exploitation of vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware. Once inside, the malware can harvest credentials, manipulate customs records, or lie dormant until activated to launch a wider ransomware attack. The combined impact of these weaponised digital attacks is catastrophic. They can lead to a complete operational shutdown, with cargo handling systems disabled, logistics platforms failing, and communication systems crippled. The result is a cascade of delays, severe financial losses from both the disruption and potential extortion payments, and significant damage to the port’s reputation for reliability. 02 The weaponisation of digital infrastructure: From disruption to extortion 13 The most dangerous maritime cyber threats are those that cross the divide from the digital to the physical world, turning malicious code into kinetic impact. These attacks target the Operational Technology (OT) at the heart of the port, manipulating the machinery that moves cargo, manages infrastructure, and ensures safety. This represents a convergence of three advanced threat vectors: SCADA/ICS sabotage, the exploitation of the IoT attack surface, and the manipulation of AI systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial control systems (ICS) are the nerve centres of a port’s physical operations. An attack on these systems, such as a sabotage scenario where a port’s automated crane system freezes mid-operation, can have immediate and devastating consequences. The core vulnerabilities of these systems are well-known and systemic. Many ports rely on legacy OT assets running software that is decades old, can no longer be patched, and was never designed with internet connectivity in mind. They often use weak or hard-coded default credentials (e.g., “admin/ admin”) and communicate using unencrypted protocols, allowing attackers to intercept and spoof commands. The most critical vulnerability, however, is the lack of strict network segmentation between IT and OT environments. The USCG CTIME report validates this widespread issue, finding that a majority of assessed organisations had flawed assumptions about their IT/OT separation, creating a direct path for an attacker to pivot from a compromised corporate email account to the controls of a ship-to-shore crane. The Internet of Things (IoT) attack surface massively compounds this risk. A smart port is a dense web of thousands of connected devices, smart sensors on refrigerated containers, CCTV cameras, RFID readers, and automated vehicle controls. These devices are a security nightmare: they are often mass-produced with minimal security, deployed with insecure default configurations that are never changed, and lack any mechanism for remote patching or firmware updates. As such, a single compromised IoT sensor on a flat, unsegmented network can serve as the perfect beachhead for an attacker. From there, they can conduct surveillance, gather intelligence on cargo movements, or pivot into the core OT network to launch a more destructive attack. This risk is amplified by a heavy reliance on foreign- manufactured equipment, such as ZPMC cranes, which introduce concerns regarding embedded backdoors and supply chain vulnerabilities at a national security level. 03 The compromise of physical operations: Crossing the cyber-physical divide 14 Artificial Intelligence (AI) manipulation represents the next frontier of cyber-physical attacks. As ports adopt AI for logistics optimisation, predictive maintenance, and autonomous systems, they open themselves to a new class of threats that target the logic of the system itself. These are not simple shutdown attacks; they are subtle and insidious manipulations. Key vectors include: Adversarial attacks: Tricking an AI’s perception model. For example, a strategically placed sticker on a container could cause an AI-driven crane’s camera to misread its destination, facilitating theft or causing logistical chaos. Data poisoning: Intentionally feeding malicious or biased data into an AI’s training set. This could teach a predictive maintenance model to ignore the signs of impending critical failure or train a security surveillance system not to recognise a specific type of threat. Model extraction: Repeatedly querying a model to reverse-engineer its logic or extract sensitive information from its training data, effectively stealing the port’s operational intelligence. These three vectors, SCADA, IoT, and AI, should not be viewed in isolation. Their true danger lies in how they can be chained together in a catastrophic attack sequence. An adversary could begin with a simple phishing email to steal credentials from a maintenance vendor (exploiting the human element). Using these credentials, they could access the network through an insecure remote connection (weaponising digital infrastructure). Discovering a flat network, they could then pivot from the IT environment directly into the OT zone. There, they could launch a sabotage attack against a legacy SCADA system to halt crane operations while simultaneously hijacking an insecure IoT camera to monitor the port’s physical response. To maximise the chaos, they could have previously poisoned the training data of an AI-powered logistics scheduler, causing it to misroute containers and create gridlock during the physical shutdown. This blended, multi-domain assault, where a vulnerability in one area enables catastrophic failure in another, demonstrates why modern defence must be holistic and integrated, treating the entire IT/OT/AI ecosystem as a single, interconnected battlespace. 15 Nine ways your port could be attacked 16 In the summer of 2017, a container terminal in Rotterdam went dark. Computer monitors froze, cranes idled, and cargo ships waited adrift – an unlikely symptom of a digital virus. The culprit: NotPetya, a particularly virulent strain of malware that had infiltrated Maersk’s global operations, disabling terminals from Mumbai to Los Angeles. It was not a targeted strike but rather collateral damage from a cyberwar experiment gone awry in Ukraine. But for the world’s largest shipping conglomerate, it was a wake-up call: the age of cyber threats had come to port. Since then, ransomware has become the dominant threat facing maritime infrastructure. The mechanics of a ransomware attack are deceptively simple: attackers lock access to critical systems or data and demand payment, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid, the data may remain locked, be released but corrupted, or be deleted altogether. The logic is cruelly effective: disable the systems, disrupt the flow of goods, and force businesses to choose between paying up or facing costly standstills. More insidiously, some ransomware variants now steal data before encrypting it, doubling the leverage. In such cases, firms face not only operational paralysis but also the threat of having sensitive financial or cargo records dumped onto the dark web. Amid the clatter of cranes and the hum of container traffic, a port administrator opened what appeared to be a routine email from a long-standing logistics partner. The branding was flawless, with an urgent yet professional tone: update shipping details via the attached file. Minutes after clicking, the port’s cargo tracking system faltered. Containers stalled. Monitors blinked to black. As engineers raced to contain the disruption, a second breach was already unfolding. A security officer received a call from someone claiming to be from IT support – calm, precise, familiar. The officer handed over login credentials without suspicion. Now, inside both backend systems and frontline terminals, the attackers moved swiftly. Berth schedules were altered. Fuel data tampered with. Communications rerouted. It wasn’t until a vessel was directed to an occupied berth that the deception became undeniable. This wasn’t a case of high-tech exploitation – it was a textbook example of low-tech deception executed flawlessly. 01 02 How ransomware is threatening the arteries of global trade The click that cracked the port: A phishing and social engineering cautionary tale 17 On a quiet Monday morning, the port’s automated crane system froze mid-operation. Containers hung suspended like ornaments above the quay. Simultaneously, the surveillance feeds flickered, then vanished. Control rooms went dark. At first, staff suspected a routine software glitch. Within minutes, it became clear: this was no accident. A cyberattack had infiltrated the port’s Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. The entry point? A remote access tool was left active by a third-party vendor. The attackers exploited outdated SCADA software still running on systems from the early 2000s – software with known vulnerabilities and no encryption. Though physical safety systems kicked in to prevent damage, the interruption caused cascading delays. Incoming vessels were redirected. Outbound shipments were halted. Millions in cargo sat idle. The attackers, never identified, vanished as silently as they arrived. They left behind no ransom note, only chaos and a costly aftermath. Modern ports may boast smart technology, but intelligence without security is a vulnerability waiting to be exploited. Every crane, gate, and fuel line connected to a network must be treated not just as machinery but as a potential attack surface. The screens in the port’s control tower went dark at 4:17 a.m. For a moment, the staff assumed a local outage. But as backup systems failed to engage and communication with vessel tracking dashboards timed out, the reality sank in: the port was under digital siege. A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack had flooded the port’s network with tens of millions of requests per second. The origin was global – botnets harnessed from unsecured IoT devices, including some from the port’s own smart sensors. Everything from surveillance feeds to cargo handling schedules was affected. The port’s cloud tools and APIs buckled under the pressure. Firewalls strained to distinguish legitimate traffic from the deluge. This was not a data breach or ransomware demand – it was digital paralysis. Unlike a targeted malware attack, a DDoS offensive does not need to penetrate. It simply overwhelms. 03 04 Locked at the dock: A SCADA sabotage scenario When the tide stops: A DDoS assault on a Smart Port 18 The port’s new logistics platform promised smoother scheduling, better cargo visibility, and seamless vendor integration. What it delivered, inadvertently, was a backdoor for malware. The malware lay dormant until triggered by a remote signal. Once activated, it quietly harvested login credentials, rerouted cargo data, and manipulated customs records. Within days, containers began disappearing from manifests, being misrouted across terminals, or held indefinitely at the dockside. Meanwhile, finance teams were alarmed to find anomalies in transaction logs – unauthorised transfers, ghost invoices, and internal emails suggesting insider fraud. But that was only the beginning. IoT devices – smart cameras, RFID readers, automated cranes – had also been infected. Some now transmitted encrypted data to unknown servers. Others were quietly repurposed into nodes of a global botnet. Many smart ports still rely on legacy infrastructure patched with modern software – an architectural mismatch ripe for exploitation. In 2011, traffickers in Antwerp didn’t storm the port – they logged in. A drug cartel, working with hackers, infiltrated the port’s IT systems, gaining quiet control of terminal operations. It began with malware-laced emails sent to shipping firms and port staff, harvesting credentials and slipping past defences. Over months, traffickers tracked containers in real time, intercepting those stuffed with cocaine before customs could. The breach was more than digital. Insiders – bribed or complicit – helped maintain access and evade suspicion. CCTV feeds were manipulated. Seals on containers appeared untouched. The operation blurred the lines between cyber intrusion and traditional smuggling. Only after containers began vanishing with unnerving precision did authorities uncover the breach. For ports – where digital control meets physical flow – it was a wake-up call. Cybersecurity wasn’t just about systems but people: the exploited trust of staff, the ease of unauthorised access, and the quiet power of knowing exactly where a shipment will land. 05 06 The Trojan in the update: Malware and supply chain attacks in ports The enemy within: Insider threats and unauthorised access in ports 19 The smart sensor monitoring refrigerated containers had one job – keeping cargo cool. What it also did, unintentionally, was act as a backdoor for hackers probing the port’s digital infrastructure. Its default login – admin/admin – had never been changed. Smart ports rely on a dense web of IoT devices, most of which are mass-produced with minimal cybersecurity, seldom receive patches, are often deployed without encryption, and, unlike corporate laptops, many IoT devices cannot be easily updated or monitored. In many cases, IoT devices broadcast sensitive data in plain text, a gift to anyone listening. When compromised, IoT devices do not just fail – they can turn hostile. Hackers can hijack security cameras to spy on port operations, disable alarms, or manipulate access gates. Cargo manifests, financial records, shipping schedules, personnel files – the modern port is as much a repository of data as a hub of goods. And that data is increasingly under siege. Ports now face a wave of digital espionage: a slow, stealthy siphoning of trade secrets and logistical intelligence. In some cases, ports have unknowingly leaked data for months before detection. Cybercriminals are no longer content to disrupt – they want to surveil, map, and monetise the data that underpins global commerce. Stolen shipping routes can aid piracy; leaked customs records enable smuggling; and detailed cargo data provides a roadmap for theft. At a busy passenger ferry terminal, disruption rarely starts with alarms. It begins with data that can’t be trusted. A manipulated maintenance log quietly marks a boarding gate as operational. Days later, the gate jams during peak boarding, halting departures. Elsewhere, the port’s AI misroutes ferries and reassigns crews based on falsified schedules. As ports adopt AI to coordinate traffic, conduct surveillance, manage logistics and passengers, they expose new digital weak points. Attackers can fool cameras, corrupt algorithms, or manipulate training data from within. Cybersecurity must now protect not just systems—but the logic guiding them. 07 08 09 The weakest link: IoT devices as port backdoors Secrets in the stream: Data breaches and digital espionage at ports Ghost in the machine: How AI manipulation could paralyse smart ports 20 The complexity and convergence of modern maritime threats demand a fundamental shift in security strategy. The traditional approach of building a strong perimeter is no longer sufficient when the perimeter itself has dissolved. True resilience requires moving from a reactive, compliance-driven posture to a proactive, integrated strategy built on the assumption of a breach. This section outlines a three-pillar framework for achieving this resilience, combining modern security architectures, defensible supply chain practices, and a deeply embedded culture of active defence. This is not a checklist of tools, but a strategic blueprint for port leadership. For decades, network security was modelled on a medieval castle: build a strong wall (perimeter firewall), a deep moat (DMZ), and control the drawbridge (access points). Anything inside the wall was trusted, and anything outside was not. In the hyper- connected port ecosystem, with its reliance on cloud services, remote vendor access, mobile devices, and interconnected IT/OT systems, this model is dangerously obsolete. The perimeter is no longer a clear line; it is a porous, ever-changing boundary. The modern paradigm is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). As defined by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Zero Trust is a set of principles that “move defenses from static, network- based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources”. Its core tenet is simple but profound: “never trust, always verify”. This means no user, device, or application is granted implicit trust based on its location (e.g., being on the corporate network). Instead, every single request to access a resource must be individually authenticated and authorised, every time. This shift from a location-centric to an identity-centric security model is the philosophical foundation of a resilient architecture. The following table illustrates the practical differences between these two approaches. The shift in mindset: From perimeter defence to assumed breach Beyond the seawall: A strategic framework for maritime cyber resilience 21 Security principle Traditional (perimeter) approach Modern (Zero Trust) approach Network access “Trust but verify.” Access is granted based on network location (inside vs. outside). “Never trust, always verify.” Access is granted based on authenticated identity, regardless of location. Remote access Broad network access is granted via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Granular, application-specific access is granted on a per-session basis via Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Threat detection Primarily relies on signature-based tools at the network edge to block known threats. Employs continuous monitoring and behavioural analytics across the entire network to detect anomalous activity. Blast radius A single breach can lead to widespread lateral movement across a flat network. The impact of a breach is contained within small, isolated segments (micro-segmentation). User identity Primarily relies on passwords, which are easily stolen or compromised. Relies on strong, verifiable identity using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and robust Identity and Access Management (IAM). Table 1: Modern resilience vs. traditional security 21 22 Pillar 1: Architecting for resilience – Securing the converged IT/OT environment A resilient port architecture cannot be improvised; it must be deliberately designed to contain threats and protect critical functions. This requires integrating proven industrial and security frameworks into a single, cohesive strategy: the Purdue Model for logical structure, the IEC 62443 standard for risk-based controls, and Zero Trust principles for enforcement. The Purdue model as the blueprint: The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA), or Purdue model, provides the foundational blueprint for logically organising and separating industrial networks. It defines a hierarchy of levels, from the physical process devices (Level 0) and basic controls (Level 1) at the bottom, through supervisory control (Level 2) and site-wide operations management (Level 3), up to the enterprise business systems (Level 4) and corporate network (Level 5) at the top. The most critical element for cybersecurity is the establishment of a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), often referred to as Level 3.5, which acts as a strictly controlled buffer between the OT environment (Levels 0-3) and the IT environment (Levels 4-5). This structure provides the map for implementing effective network segmentation. IEC 62443 for OT security controls: While the Purdue model provides the map, the IEC 62443 series of standards provides the rules for securing it. This international standard for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security operationalises the Purdue concept by defining: • Zones and conduits: A zone is a logical grouping of assets with common security requirements (e.g., all crane control systems). A conduit is the managed communication channel between zones. This allows for the enforcement of security policies at every boundary. • Security levels (SLs): IEC 62443 introduces a risk-based approach to applying controls. It defines four security levels (SL1 to SL4) that correspond to the sophistication of the threat actor, from accidental misuse (SL1) to a nation- state adversary with extensive resources (SL4). This allows organisations to apply proportionate, measurable, and verifiable security controls to each zone based on its criticality and the threats it faces, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Pillar 1 Architecting for resilience – Securing the converged IT/OT environment 22 23 Zero Trust as the enforcement layer: Zero Trust principles provide the dynamic enforcement mechanism for this architecture. It is the “always verify” engine that governs every connection request attempting to cross a zone boundary. Key ZTA applications in this context include: • Micro-segmentation: Using next-generation firewalls and access control lists to enforce the zones and conduits defined by the Purdue/IEC 62443 model, preventing unauthorised lateral movement between systems. A breach of a less critical system, like an environmental sensor, is thus prevented from escalating to an attack on a safety-critical controller. • Strong identity and access management (IAM): Implementing a robust IAM program is central to ZTA. This includes enforcing the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users and services have the absolute minimum permissions required. For all administrators, engineers, and third-party vendors, access must be brokered through a privileged access management (PAM) solution that mandates phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), grants time-bound access, and logs all session activity. • Continuous OT network monitoring: Since security agents cannot be installed on most legacy OT devices, resilience depends on monitoring network traffic for signs of compromise. Specialised network detection and response (NDR) tools, capable of understanding industrial protocols, combined with security information and event management (SIEM) and user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) platforms, are used to baseline normal activity and automatically detect anomalies indicative of a threat. Together, these three frameworks form a powerful, integrated “Purdue-IEC-ZTA” stack. The Purdue model provides the logical architecture. IEC 62443 defines the risk-based security requirements and controls for that architecture. Zero Trust provides the dynamic, identity-centric enforcement philosophy that governs all activity within it. This unified strategy provides a clear, actionable, and defensible roadmap for securing the entire converged IT/OT environment. 23 24 Pillar 2: Building a defensible supply chain – Managing third- party and technology risk A port’s security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the modern ecosystem, that weak link is often a third-party supplier or a piece of insecure technology. The supply chain has become a primary attack vector, with the 2024 Verizon DBIR noting a significant increase in breaches involving a third party. Furthermore, the reliance on foreign-manufactured port equipment, such as cranes and scanners, introduces geopolitical risks and concerns about embedded vulnerabilities. A defensible supply chain strategy must address risk across vendors, hardware, and software. Rigorous vendor risk management: The process of vetting third-party suppliers must evolve beyond simple questionnaires. Ports should contractually mandate that all vendors with network access provide independently audited proof of their security posture, such as a recent SOC 2 Type II report or ISO/IEC 27001 certification. Contracts must include legally binding security clauses that grant the port a “Right to Audit” the vendor’s security, and which define strict service level agreements (SLAs) for incident notification, for example, requiring notification of a critical incident within two hours. Secure technology procurement and lifecycle management: Security must be a primary consideration in all technology procurement decisions. • Hardware: Equipment such as IoT devices, sensors, and PLCs should only be sourced from manufacturers who adhere to a transparent secure development lifecycle (SDL). A critical and non-negotiable step in the commissioning process must be to immediately change all default credentials, replacing them with unique, complex passwords managed in a secure vault. • Software: Ports must demand a complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from all software vendors. This inventory of all components and libraries is essential for tracking dependencies and responding quickly when a new vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library. Furthermore, the cryptographic integrity of all new software, patches, and firmware updates must be validated before deployment by verifying digital signatures and checking file hashes against known-good values. Pillar 2 Building a defensible supply chain – Managing third-party and technology risk 24 25 This proactive approach to supply chain security is now being codified by new industry regulations. The IACS Unified Requirements UR E26 and E27, which become mandatory for new ships contracted for construction after July 1, 2024, represent a fundamental shift in accountability. UR E27 focuses on component-level security, requiring original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to build specific security capabilities into their computer-based systems from the ground up. UR E26 addresses the vessel as a whole, requiring the shipbuilder and, later, the owner to maintain a complete asset inventory, document network architecture, and implement a cyber risk management program aligned with the six functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Governance, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). These IACS requirements act as a powerful forcing function for securing the maritime supply chain. They create a clear chain of accountability that runs from the individual component manufacturer, through the systems integrator and shipbuilder, to the vessel owner. For a port operator, this is a significant development. It means that, over time, vessels arriving at their berths will possess a baseline, verifiable level of cyber resilience, reducing the overall risk to the entire port ecosystem. 25 26 Pillar 3 Fostering a culture of active defence – People, process, and preparedness Even the most advanced technology and resilient architecture will fail if not supported by robust processes and a security-conscious culture. The human element is consistently identified as the weakest link, but with the right approach, it can be transformed into the strongest line of defence. This pillar focuses on embedding security into the organisation’s DNA, from the boardroom to the quayside. Executive governance and security culture: Effective cybersecurity starts at the top. It must be treated as a board-level issue, integrated into the organisation’s overall safety culture, not siloed within the IT department. This requires senior management to actively oversee the cybersecurity program, establish clear roles and responsibilities for both IT and OT security, and ensure that a culture of risk awareness is promoted at all levels of the organisation. Advanced security awareness training: To build a resilient “human firewall,” training must evolve beyond annual, check-the-box compliance exercises. A modern program should be: Continuous: Delivered in short, regular modules (microlearning) to keep security top-of-mind. Engaging: Using interactive content, videos, and gamification to hold employees’ attention. Realistic: Employing sophisticated phishing simulations that mimic real-world attacks to test and improve vigilance. Role-based: Tailoring content to the specific threats faced by different departments (e.g., finance, operations, HR). Empowering: Educating staff on how to recognise the signs of a potential insider threat and providing clear, confidential, and no-fault channels for reporting suspicious activity. OT-specific incident response (IR): A generic IT incident response plan is inadequate and potentially dangerous in OT environments, where mishandled responses could trigger physical accidents. The IR plan must be tailored to industrial control systems’ unique challenges, prioritising operational safety. This demands detailed playbooks for OT-specific scenarios, such as SCADA compromises, ransomware on Terminal Operating Systems, or safety- instrumented system failures. Plans require regular testing through tabletop exercises involving IT, OT, operations, and executive participants for coordinated responses, plus simulated real-time drills that evaluate those responses, protected systems, and coordination tools. The imperative for robust governance, training, and response is now being driven by powerful new regulations, most notably the EU’s NIS2 Directive. Effective as of October 2024, NIS2 dramatically raises the stakes for critical infrastructure operators, including ports. It mandates a comprehensive set of risk management measures, including supply chain security, incident handling, and robust access control. It also imposes strict reporting timelines, requiring an initial notification of a significant incident within 24 hours. Most critically, NIS2 introduces direct liability for senior management, who can be held personally accountable for non-compliance. Pillar 3 Fostering a culture of active defence – People, processes, and preparedness 26 27 Regulation Scope / applicability Key mandates Penalties / enforcement IMO MSC.428(98) All vessels are subject to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. Integrate cyber risk management into the existing safety management system (SMS). Enforced through Port State Control inspections; can lead to vessel detention or findings on the company’s Document of Compliance. IACS UR E26/E27 Newbuild vessels over 500 GT contracted after July 1, 2024. E27: Technical security requirements for onboard computer systems. E26: Ship-level resilience requirements (asset inventory, segmentation, risk management). Enforced by Classification Societies, non- compliance can result in the denial of class certification, impacting insurance and operational viability. EU NIS2 directive “Essential” and “Important” entities in the EU transport sector (including ports, managing bodies, and water transport companies). Implement specific cybersecurity risk management measures, secure supply chains, establish incident response plans, and adhere to strict 24-hour incident reporting. Direct enforcement by national authorities. Fines up to €10 million or 2 % of global turnover. Personal liability for senior management. Table 2: The maritime regulatory landscape at a glance The penalties are severe, with fines for “essential entities” reaching up to €10 million or 2 % of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. The following table provides a high-level comparison of the key regulations shaping the maritime cyber landscape. These regulations, particularly NIS2, provide a powerful financial and legal incentive for boards and C-suites to make cybersecurity a strategic priority, transforming it from a technical issue into a fundamental component of corporate governance. 27 28 Making the business case: From cost centre to competitive advantage For too long, cybersecurity has been viewed as a necessary but burdensome cost centre. This perspective is no longer tenable. In the modern maritime environment, robust cybersecurity is a direct enabler of business objectives. The business case for investment rests on three pillars: risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation. The return on investment (ROI) for security is often framed by the costs of inaction. As detailed earlier, the financial impact of a single incident, from downtime costs exceeding €200,000 per hour to multi-million-dollar ransom payments and regulatory fines, can be catastrophic. Proactive investment in measures like network segmentation and incident response planning has been shown to significantly reduce the impact of a breach, minimising operational disruption and containing financial damage. A port that can demonstrate a mature, resilient security posture is fundamentally a more reliable partner in a fragile global supply chain. This reliability becomes a powerful competitive differentiator, attracting customers who are increasingly aware of the systemic risks posed by cyber threats. Furthermore, the new wave of regulations like IACS UR E26/E27 and the NIS2 directive provides a clear catalyst for modernisation. The looming deadlines and severe penalties for non-compliance create an undeniable impetus for budget allocation and strategic planning. Forward-thinking organisations will use these regulations not as a ceiling to aim for, but as a floor upon which to build a truly resilient security program that goes beyond mere compliance to become a source of operational strength. Charting the course: An action plan for port leadership Understanding the threats and the strategic framework for resilience is essential, but it is not enough. Leadership requires a clear, actionable plan to translate strategy into reality. This concluding section outlines the business case for investment in cybersecurity and provides a practical, phased roadmap for implementation. It reframes cybersecurity not as a cost to be minimised, but as a critical investment in operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and long-term competitive advantage. 29 Phase 1: Foundational visibility and governance Actions: • Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment: Engage experts to perform a thorough assessment of the converged IT and OT environments to identify critical assets, vulnerabilities, and realistic threat scenarios. • Create a complete asset inventory: Develop and maintain a detailed inventory of all connected IT, OT, and IoT assets, including their software versions and network connections. This is a foundational requirement of IACS UR E26. • Establish cross-functional governance: Form a cybersecurity steering committee with representation from IT, OT, operations, legal, and executive leadership to ensure strategic alignment and oversight. • Develop and test an OT-specific incident response plan: Create an initial IR plan tailored to OT environments, prioritising safety and operational continuity. Test this plan with a tabletop exercise involving all key stakeholders. • Goal: To move from a state of unknown risk to one of understood risk, with clear governance and a baseline plan for crisis management. A phased roadmap to resilience The journey to a mature, Zero Trust-based security posture is a marathon, not a sprint. A phased approach allows organisations to make meaningful progress, achieve early wins, and build momentum over time. The following three-phase roadmap provides a high-level guide for port leadership. The first phase is about understanding the terrain and establishing control. You cannot protect what you cannot see. 29 30 Phase 2: Architectural hardening Phase 3: Advanced resilience and optimisation Actions: • Implement foundational network segmentation: Architect the network according to the Purdue model, establishing a DMZ to create a hard separation between the IT and OT environments. • Deploy OT-aware network monitoring: Implement passive network detection and response (NDR) tools within the OT environment to gain visibility into traffic patterns and detect anomalous behaviour. • Begin implementing robust IAM/PAM: Roll out a privileged access management (PAM) solution for all administrative and remote access to critical OT systems, enforcing multi- factor authentication (MFA). • Goal: To significantly reduce the attack surface and limit an adversary’s ability to move laterally from IT to OT, thereby containing the blast radius of a potential breach. Actions: • Mature towards a full Zero Trust architecture: Implement micro-segmentation within the OT environment, creating smaller security zones around critical processes and assets to further contain threats. • Integrate advanced threat detection: Enhance monitoring capabilities by integrating SIEM and UEBA platforms to correlate alerts from across the IT/OT landscape and use AI-based analytics to detect sophisticated threats. • Formalise and automate supply chain security: Implement automated tools for validating software integrity (SBOM analysis, cryptographic verification) and formalise the vendor risk management program with contractual and audit requirements. • Goal: To achieve a state of active, adaptive defence and continuous improvement that can detect and respond to threats in real-time, underpinned by a secure architecture and a resilient supply chain. With a clear understanding of the environment, the next phase focuses on building foundational architectural controls to contain threats. The final phase involves maturing the security program toward a dynamic, proactive state of defence. 30 31 As ports continue to innovate, the security paradigm must evolve in lockstep. The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence for logistics optimisation and the deployment of autonomous trucks and drones introduce a new and complex attack surface. Securing these systems cannot be an ad hoc; it must be integral to their design and deployment. The focus must be on securing the entire machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline—the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying AI models. This requires a new set of security controls, including: • Data provenance and integrity: Ensuring that the data used to train AI models comes from trusted sources and has not been tampered with or “poisoned” by an adversary. • Model integrity verification: Using cryptographic techniques to ensure that the AI model deployed in production is the same one that was tested and validated, preventing unauthorised modification. • Secure runtimes: Deploying models in hardened, isolated environments (e.g., secure containers) to protect them from compromise during operation. By addressing these emerging challenges proactively, port operators can ensure that their investments in next-generation technology deliver on their promise of efficiency without introducing unacceptable levels of risk. The Future is Now: Securing AI and autonomous operations 32 The maritime industry is at a critical inflexion point. The forces of digitalisation and global connectivity that have revolutionised trade have also brought a new era of systemic risk. The choice facing port leadership is no longer whether to invest in cybersecurity, but whether to manage this risk strategically or have it managed for them by adversaries and regulators. In today’s interconnected maritime economy, cyber resilience is inextricably linked to operational resilience. It is the invisible infrastructure that underpins the reliability, safety, and continuity of global trade. Building this resilience is a shared responsibility that demands collaboration across the industry ecosystem, from technology vendors and shipping lines to regulators and port authorities. But it begins with decisive leadership. By embracing a strategic framework built on resilient architecture, defensible supply chains, and a culture of active defence, ports can chart a course through the turbulent waters of the digital age, securing not only their own operations but also their vital role in the global economy.

    "content": "Home Insights Smart Ports: what about RoRo terminal digitalization? Article September 19, 2024 Smart Ports: what about RoRo terminal digitalization? The focus is on trailer yards! As the demands of logistics continue to grow, ports are increasingly looking to digitalization and smart technologies to streamline operations, close existing gaps that have remained from the first wave of digitalization, to enhance security, and to deliver better value to the logistics ecosystems. Service Strategy and Transformation Industry Industry Logistics While most trailer terminals in developed countries have already long ago taken first steps to digitalize parts of operating procedures (for example gate operating systems) , we see a new wave starting now. Difficulties of the current macro-economic environment require optimi zation at every step, and this means taking an end-to-end view of the operations, closing current blind spots, and using the latest innovations of data science and business analytics to move into the next phase of RoRo terminal efficiency . Understanding the challenges in RoRo terminals Trailer terminals, especially those handling unaccompanied trailers, face unique challenges. These include managing a vast influx of vehicles, ensuring accurate cargo validation, optimizing yard space, making best use of capacity and human resources, enabling even faster turnaround times, and maintaining smooth data flows across various systems. Many terminals still rely on outdated Terminal Operating Systems (TOS) that, while functional, often lack the flexibility and integration needed to address modern challenges. This often results in operational inefficiencies, data silos, and bottlenecks that impede overall productivity. Changing these terminal operating systems can be costly and time-consuming. But necessary for innovation. As global trade continues to expand, the volume and complexity of operations in trailer terminals are expected to increase, placing additional strain on already stretched resources. This calls for a strategic approach to digitalization—one that not only addresses current pain points but also positions terminals for future growth. The shift toward Smart Ports The solution lies in the adoption of Smart Port technologies, which integrate advanced digital tools to enhance the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of port operations. For trailer terminals, this means embracing a comprehensive digitalization strategy that covers every aspect of the terminal’s operations, from cargo validation and yard management to customer communications and advanced analytics. Key components of a Smart Port for trailer terminals include: Automated cargo validation Automating cargo validation processes can significantly reduce the time trucks spend at the terminal gate, improving throughput and reducing congestion. This can be achieved with technologies such as automatic truck and unit detection systems that capture weight, 3D measurements, and trailer numbers as vehicles approach the terminal. Additionally, implementing AI-assisted damage control systems can help identify and document potential damage, providing a reliable record for both the terminal and its customers. As an extension of cargo validation, the identification of people needs to take place to varying degrees. If not for passenger manifests, then for the safety of cargo and terminal operations. Various digital identity verification solutions can be of great help here (incl. biometrics, document scanners, RFID tags etc.) Cargo movement Enhancing cargo movement efficiency within a terminal can be achieved through real-time information sharing and optimized traffic management. By providing expected handling times and assigning time slots for entry and cargo pickup, terminals can streamline the flow of trucks. Modern systems are experts at optimizing every move in the terminal to make sure that no movement is made in vain – no empty driving. By predictive analytics of trailer yard capacity, expected vessel arrival and departure times, the correct trailer movements can be assigned for staff at the right point in time (e.g. optimal pre-loading). Advanced yard management systems Effective yard management is crucial for maximizing the use of available space and ensuring smooth operations. Modern yard management systems can assign parking slots dynamically based on real-time data, ensuring optimal use of space and minimizing the need for manual intervention. These systems can also track the movement of trailers within the terminal, providing operators with a clear overview of the yard’s status at any given moment. Loading and Unloading Streamlining loading and unloading processes requires robust pre-planning and real-time communication. Work orders can be generated in advance to coordinate trailer loading and unloading, providing a comprehensive overview of booked trailers. An app facilitates communication about which units are required on the vessel, while a logbook automatically timestamps loading and unloading at the ramp, updating trailer statuses in real-time. Detection systems warn operators if the wrong trailer is about to be loaded. At the terminal exit, trucks and trailers are identified, and exits are blocked for those that haven’t passed customs, require security checks, or don’t match the pick-up order. Oversight and analytics Enhanced oversight and analytics tools enable real-time tracking and monitoring of trailer movements throughout the terminal. Timestamps are captured at each step, giving a real-time picture of trailer locations. A visual digital twin of the yard, combined with video surveillance, helps identify trailer movements, parking, theft, accidents, and safety violations. CCTV feeds integrated into a user interface provide a live overview of key terminal areas. Operational reporting, including inventory, productivity, and shift performance metrics, along with hardware performance monitoring and predictive maintenance, are also managed. Additionally, a sustainability portal tracks environmental statistics. Planning and management The Smart Port systems help to set up the digital trailer yard in a comprehensive and proactive manner. Every aspect of terminal operations is supported by technology and the operating procedures of the digital yard can be changed by a click of a mouse. Effective planning and management involve adjusting business rules, such as random checks, and coordinating vessel arrivals, berth bookings, and departures via Just-In-Time (JIT) systems. Lane allocation, self-service kiosk usage, and arrival slot bookings are planned, with automatic suggestions for yard planning based on departures, volumes, and available staff. Work order planning across the terminal includes loading, reorganizing, and temperature checks, allowing both automated suggestions and manual adjustments. Traffic management schemes and driver communications are configured, with real-time display updates guiding logistics companies and drivers efficiently. Building a roadmap for digital transformation While the benefits of Smart Ports are clear, the path to digital transformation can be complex. Terminal operators need to balance the need for quick wins—such as improving yard management and cargo validation—with the longer-term goal of building a fully integrated digital ecosystem. A practical approach is to start with a high-level plan that outlines the target operating model for the terminal. This should include an assessment of current operations, identification of key challenges, and a clear vision of the future state. With this roadmap in place, terminals can prioritize investments in technology, ensuring that each step forward is aligned with the overall strategy. From my discussions in the industry, I have realized that there are extensive ways to improve RoRo terminal operations by tuning in on the operational challenges, coming up with tailored solutions, and working with our ecosystem partners to build technology enabled operating models that are fit for purpose. What’s next for RoRo terminals? The move towards advanced Smart Ports is not just about adopting new technologies ; it’s about rethinking how terminals operate to meet the demands of a rapidly changing industry. By embracing digitalization, terminals can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and deliver better service to their customers. The key is to take a strategic, phased approach that balances immediate operational improvements with long-term digital integration .

    "content": "Embedding Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat resilience 3 Cybercrime is predicted to cost the world about €10.5 trillion in 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. 4 Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. There is much industry discussion regarding the transition from reactive to proactive cybersecurity, but true cyber resilience demands both. We must accept the inevitable: our organisations will be attacked. While detection and prevention remain crucial, the hallmark of a resilient organisation lies in its ability to respond to and recover from cyber incidents effectively. This mindset means putting measures in place that limit damage and keep critical functions running— ensuring your business stays operational even against the most sophisticated attacks. This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience— embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer- centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 1 90% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 2 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months 3 1 https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-cybersecurity-outlook-2025/digest/ 2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/navigating-cybersecurity-investments-in-the-time-of-nis-2 3 https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-cybersecurity-outlook-2024/ 4 https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/quicksight/check-point/the-worlds-third-largest-economy-has-bad-intentions-and-its-only-getting-bigger 5 4 The importance of continuous and iterative cybersecurity: The WannaCry cyberattack Resilience is a sign of maturity in an organisation. Robust organisations have pivoted from the misguided notion of outright prevention to a focus on resilience—the “when, not if” mentality. Those same organisations understand that a high wall is never enough; a plan must be developed, implemented, and tested for when an organisation is breached, but a real plan, not just a token one. On May 12, 2017, the world witnessed one of the gravest ransomware attacks in history—WannaCry. This self-propagating ransomware worm exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows called EternalBlue, a leaked exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The attack spread rapidly across the globe, encrypting files on infected systems and demanding $300 in Bitcoin for decryption, doubling if payment wasn’t made within three days. Within hours, WannaCry had infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, telecom companies, and government agencies were among the hardest hit. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) suffered massive disruptions with up to 70,000 affected devices, from MRI scanners to operating theatres, forcing hospitals to cancel surgeries and turn away patients. FedEx, Boeing, Deutsche Bahn, and many automotive manufacturers were also affected. Organisations faced severe consequences: financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. The global cost is estimated at between €4 and €8 billion. 4 Despite its scale, WannaCry could have been prevented. Microsoft had released a security patch (MS17-010) two months prior, but many organisations, for one reason or another, had yet to update their systems. Beyond patching, a comprehensive resilience approach—including initiatives such as proper governance, network segmentation, endpoint detection, backup strategies, incident response planning, and employee awareness—would have significantly reduced the impact. A major turning point came when a security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, accidentally discovered a ‘kill switch,’ a hardcoded domain that, when registered, stopped WannaCry’s spread. While this fortunate discovery helped contain the initial outbreak, variants without this kill switch later emerged. This evolution demonstrates that reliance on reactive, one-time solutions is inherently risky. Had organisations implemented a culture of resilience rather than depending on emergency interventions, they would have been better positioned against both the original attack and its variants. The WannaCry saga ultimately proves that cyber resilience requires systematic, proactive approaches rather than hoping for last-minute rescues. 7 Token efforts vs. business benefit Despite the clear risk, many, if not most, companies are not acting with sincerity in the face of growing cyberattacks. Token efforts are the norm. There are two key indicators of such superficial approaches: First, companies that lack a senior business leader who champions cybersecurity at the executive level. While formal structures may vary, the absence of C-suite advocacy and accountability—whether through a dedicated information security board or direct representation in leadership meetings— signals that security isn’t truly embedded in business strategy. The second indicator is inadequate risk management: either cyber risks are absent from operational risk registers entirely, or they exist merely as generic entries without proper classification, regular updates, or specific mitigation plans. Simply having “cyber” listed on a risk register without corresponding awareness campaigns and training for all employees reveals a disconnect between acknowledged risks and meaningful action. To some extent, this is understandable; the market demands we “move fast,” forcing us into a constant race to deliver products and services quickly. This urgency often relegates security to secondary importance due to the misconception that it impedes speed and agility. When security isn’t integrated from the beginning as part of the design process, it becomes a bottleneck, requiring expensive rework and retroactive changes. What’s ironic is that secure-by-design products actually serve as powerful market differentiators in today’s landscape, where consumers increasingly value the protection of their data and privacy. Take AI, for example. If a proven-secure AI product existed, that would be a market differentiator. Imagine a self-driving car with engineered resilience in data protection and also in servicing the vehicle and in customer relationships. But this does not exist. The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Business benefit defined Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Take, for example, the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act. While the CRA is not applicable in the United States or the United Kingdom, these countries have, or soon will, their own fundamentally similar 1 legislation—a mandated cyber resilience requirement to do business within their territory. So, one quantifiable return on cyber resilience is the very ability to operate in those markets. A second quantifiable benefit is reduced spending on incident response and recovery. For example, in 2024, the average cost of a data breach was €4.66 million, and the average cost of a malicious insider attack was €4.76 million, according to IBM’s Cost of Data Breach Report. 1 https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=12363882-4860-4e64-944c-3c5be3e327ab 9 1 https://nortal.com/insights/creating-trust-digital-government/ Nortal trust formula: Trust = reliability x fairness x transparency ± execution However, Accenture’s research shows that those who prioritize cyber investments experience up to three times lower cyber breach costs than their peers. So, a security program as a resilience measure is an order of magnitude cheaper than trying to rebuild the company post-compromise. This is true both financially and reputationally, the latter more often reflected in customer behaviour or share price. Take, for example, the shipping giant Maersk—the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 infected almost 50,000 of their systems across 600 sites in 130 countries. The losses grew to nearly €300 million, affecting close to 90,000 workers, port infrastructure, customers, and end-users. This single attack caused a 20% drop in business volume. Within the public sector, cyber incidents can also cause serious downtime, disrupting essential services and threatening public safety and national security. Finally, it is worth noting that companies that respond well to a cyberattack—meaning they have resilience measures in place and react with speed and transparency— typically experience stronger recoveries, often seeing their share prices rise above pre- incident levels. The Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2023 emphasizes this, terming companies that align security with business objectives “cyber transformers.” These companies reported 26% lower costs from breaches than other respondent organisations and were 18% more likely to increase revenue growth. Effective incident response and transparent communication significantly impact reputation—particularly crucial for public sector organisations where reputation directly builds citizen trust, an asset more valuable than gold. Trust serves as democracy’s foundation, providing governments with the legitimacy needed for effective operation. Citizens willingly share their data in trusted relationships, enabling enhanced digital services. However, this creates an obligation for organisations to safeguard the data entrusted to them. At Nortal, we define trust through the principles of reliability, fairness, and transparency, with successful execution being the critical factor that brings these elements together. 1 Average cost of a data breach in 2024 was €4.66 million Average cost of a malicious insider attack in 2024 was €4.76 million 11 So, what does cyber resilience cost? It is not a percentage of your turnover but rather depends on your needs. The key questions to ask are: 1 https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/ • How does the organisation make money or deliver value? • What are the organisation’s critical outputs and/ or services provided? • What is the threat to each? • Does it matter if these systems or information are unavailable for an hour? A day? A week? Can the business continue to function? • Ultimately, what compensating or mitigating controls need to be put in place? The cost of resilience The answers to these questions dictate the resilience measures needed and, thus, costs. The most important aspect is that the cyber resilience program is aligned with the business. It is a mistake to optimise for the wrong problem. A company that does not manufacture nuclear missiles may not need state-of-the-art security; for a local bakery, state-of-the-art would arguably be overkill. High levels of resilience are expensive and might be unnecessary for your business context. But if you operate a real-time business, having your services unavailable even for a few seconds or minutes could mean more revenue lost than a solution would cost. The human element represents a significant cost factor in cyber resilience planning. According to Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report 1, 68% of breaches involve a non-malicious human element, making people the most expensive vulnerability to address. Social engineering attacks succeed when employees click malicious links or divulge sensitive information, often resulting in costly breaches. Failing to invest in human-centred resilience measures represents a substantial financial risk. A comprehensive cyber resilience budget must allocate resources to inform and train employees, conduct regular security exercises to test defences, and develop robust response and recovery protocols. The cost extends beyond internal measures to include communication systems for stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies. This human dimension of cyber resilience is a discipline requiring specific investment but one that typically delivers the highest return in breach prevention and cost avoidance. Most important is to realize there is no “silver bullet.” The fact that millions are spent is no guarantee of security. True cyber resilience means a constant review of investment to keep pace with changing threats and adversaries. One does not build a house in a dangerous neighbourhood without expecting to incur security expenses. Thieves are constantly finding new ways of breaking and entering, and the market keeps pace with the development of better locks and alarms. For this reason, cyber resilience should be viewed as a continuous process that must be sized to the needs of the business. 13 03 04 Resilient response & business continuity Ensures the organisation can effectively respond to incidents while maintaining critical business operations, minimising impact, and returning to normal functioning. Acknowledging that no security posture is impervious to all threats, this building block integrates incident response capabilities with business continuity planning. This integrated approach is particularly distinctive in that it assumes incidents are inevitable and thus focuses on both swift tactical response and sustained operational resilience. By combining these elements, organisations can minimise downtime, maintain service delivery, and preserve customer trust throughout the incident lifecycle. • Incident response planning and crisis management frameworks • Business continuity strategies aligned with organisational priorities • Cross-functional coordination with clearly defined roles and responsibilities • Real-time damage assessment tied to operational impact metrics • Predefined operational priorities to guide resource allocation during incidents • Alternative processing capabilities for critical business functions • Systematic restoration procedures following predetermined sequence priorities • Stakeholder communication protocols scaled by incident severity • Redundancy in systems and data processing capabilities • Service Level Resilience Objectives that balance security and operational requirements • Supply chain security and third-party risk management • Simulated exercises and tabletop drills to validate response and continuity measures • Processes for rapid containment and eradication of threats • Operational dependency mapping to identify critical business pathways • Post-incident reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements Intelligence & adaption 02 01 The “why” of cyber resilience sets the vision, policies, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and strategic direction. A comprehensive governance and strategy framework is at the heart of any cyber resilience program. This building block functions as the command centre of cyber resilience, setting the overarching vision, establishing critical policies, and defining the organisation’s risk appetite alongside its strategic direction. Meticulously mapping internal policies to the requirements of various external frameworks creates a resilient and compliant operational environment. The traditional defence layer implements technical and procedural safeguards to minimise the likelihood of breaches. Having all the technical and procedural safeguards in place helps maintain a vigilant stance and enhances the continuous monitoring of the security posture. In essence, while the protect and secure element aims to prevent incidents through a layered defence approach, it is also a critical foundation that supports the other building blocks of cyber resilience. A continuous learning loop that leverages threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and post-incident analysis to evolve defences and responses The intelligence and adaption block ensures that organisations can systematically analyse the value of their current defences and make informed adjustments where necessary. Moreover, the adaption process involves internalizing lessons learned from post-incident reviews and active engagement with external intelligence sources and collaborative industry networks. This ensures that our organisations learn and grow from our own experiences and also from those of other organisations. It also ensures that we remain at the forefront of best practices and can continually refine our policies and processes to meet new challenges head-on. • Deliberate security architectures aligned to organisational goals, objectives, and structures • Resilience by design principles • Supply chain security controls • Security culture and capability development • Access controls, encryption, and network security measures • Endpoint and application security • Regular vulnerability assessments, patch management, and continuous security and business alignment validation • Alignment with the “Protect” function of NIST and the Annex A controls of ISO 27001 • Proactive threat hunting and continuous monitoring • Intelligence-led testing and validation • Analytics, reporting, and feedback mechanisms • Emerging Tech impact assessments • Predictive analytics • Incorporation of lessons learned into strategy, policy, and process updates • Engagement with external intelligence sources and collaboration with industry peers • Review of emerging threats and recommendations regarding strategy, policy, and process • Leadership commitment and clear accountability • Risk management and asset identification (aligns with NIST’s Identify function and ISO’s context and leadership clauses) • Integration of cyber resilience into business continuity planning • Regular review and refinement of policies to address evolving threats • Regulatory and legal compliance, mapping to relevant standards • Organisational value alignment; cyber strategies support business objectives and value generation • Reporting structures and escalation pathways • Investment prioritization • Operational dependency mapping • Operational Impact analysis (BIA) Governance & strategy The building blocks of embedding resilience Protect & secure A complete checklist to a comprehensively cyber resilient organisation 15 Embedding resilience To embed the cyber resilience process, we need to embrace erudition, constantly learn from our mistakes, and then adapt and apply those lessons to any given context, not once, not twice, but continuously. Cyber resilience can then be embedded through four distinct phases, constantly monitored as threats and risks evolve. Approaches to embedding cyber resilience will necessarily vary based on organisational maturity. Organisations with lower maturity levels should prioritize foundational understanding—identifying problems, mapping threats, and quantifying the business impact of potential downtime or data loss. Meanwhile, more mature organisations can devote greater resources toward implementation and advanced resilience strategies, building upon their existing security framework. 17 Phase 1: Mission mapping Mission mapping begins with a deep exploration of organisational purpose, going beyond surface-level statements to understand the fundamental value an organisation provides to its stakeholders. This understanding forms the basis for identifying critical functions—those essential activities that must be maintained even under adverse conditions. Value stream and dependency mapping provide insight into how the organisation creates and delivers value, revealing obvious and subtle interdependencies that could affect resilience. This mapping exercise extends to stakeholder relationships, creating a comprehensive understanding of how the organisation interacts with its ecosystem, including its supply chain. This phase is the key element to resilience. Knowing an organisation’s purpose and how it fulfils that purpose allows assumptions to be made and examined. Take an electric vehicle company as an example. One might assume the company earns its revenue from selling vehicles, which may be true. But what if it made its revenue from reselling data to other manufacturers of vehicles? Incorrect assumptions often lead to over-optimisation for the wrong outcome. Historically, this problem has been made worse as cyber was seen as a technical problem, one decoupled from the business context and given to engineers to resolve. Present an engineer with a problem, and it’s possible you’ll receive an exquisite overengineered solution. Mission mapping ensures that the right business problem is addressed so that solutions are scaled and applied where they are actually needed. Phase 2: Capability assessment Capability assessment involves systematically evaluating an organisation’s current adaptive capacity (its ability to absorb disruption without critically impacting business operations and/or value generation), therefore, gauging its ability to respond to both challenges and opportunities. This assessment spans protection security measures, operational flexibility, and intelligence capabilities, providing a comprehensive view of organisational resilience. The assessment process employs both quantitative (recovery time objective (RTO), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and qualitative (Resilience Culture Assessment, Crisis Simulation Performance) measures, recognizing that resilience cannot be reduced to simple metrics. Instead, it considers multiple capability dimensions, from technical controls to human factors and organisational culture. Phase 3: Gap analysis Gap analysis compares an organisation’s current resilience posture against its desired state, identifying areas for improvement across all framework layers. This desired state is typically defined through industry frameworks (such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, etc.), regulatory requirements, and organisation-specific objectives established during the mission mapping phase. This analysis considers not just capability gaps but also opportunities for enhancement and innovation. The prioritization of improvements considers both the criticality of identified gaps and the organisation’s capacity for change (an element of its adaptive capacity). Action planning then creates realistic roadmaps for closing these gaps while maintaining operational stability and acknowledging constraints (time, budget, etc.). Phase 4: Implementation Implementation focuses on executing prioritized improvements while maintaining operational continuity. This phase emphasizes incremental improvement, balance across technology and culture, and the importance of measurement and feedback. It ensures that improvements achieve their intended outcomes while avoiding unintended consequences and/or seizing fleeting opportunities. Establishing feedback mechanisms and learning protocols ensures that the implementation process contributes to organisational learning and capability development (value generation). This creates a virtuous cycle that can fundamentally alter the business, requiring a re-evaluation of mission mapping and continuous improvement in resilience capability. Adopting the “when, not if” mindset ensures that organisations are prepared to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats with minimal disruption. Resilience is not a one-time investment but an ongoing commitment—requiring continuous monitoring, training, and adaptation to remain effective. By embedding cyber resilience into daily operations and long-term planning, organisations can mitigate damage, maintain trust, safeguard business continuity, and save money. In an era where cyber threats are inevitable, true resilience lies in a culture of resilience-by-design thinking.

    "content": "Embedding Becoming cyber resilient through accepting the threat resilience 3 Cybercrime is predicted to cost the world about €10.5 trillion in 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. 4 Cybercrime, often called the dark underbelly of digitalisation, continues to rise rapidly like an epidemic. While organisations are inclined to focus on prevention, the alarming statistics should push us to accept the reality that attacks are inevitable and adopt the “when, not if” approach, shifting our pursuit from the illusion of perfect security toward an achievable goal of cyber resilience. There is much industry discussion regarding the transition from reactive to proactive cybersecurity, but true cyber resilience demands both. We must accept the inevitable: our organisations will be attacked. While detection and prevention remain crucial, the hallmark of a resilient organisation lies in its ability to respond to and recover from cyber incidents effectively. This mindset means putting measures in place that limit damage and keep critical functions running— ensuring your business stays operational even against the most sophisticated attacks. This resilience-focused approach becomes even more critical as digital transformation accelerates, exponentially expanding the threat surface. When treated as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint, cyber resilience— embedded throughout the organisation’s operating model—can actually amplify digital initiatives while digital capabilities strengthen security postures. Organisations must, therefore, integrate robust security controls into all transformation projects (including new product launches, acquisitions, and market expansions) from inception, not as an afterthought. Cyber resilience transcends being merely an incident-driven technical function; it is a dynamic mindset and adaptive culture that evolves alongside both threats and opportunities. While tools like firewalls and threat detection systems play an essential role, true resilience depends on people, processes, and leadership commitment to cybersecurity best practices. A resilient culture means that employees at all levels understand cyber risks, take proactive measures, and respond effectively to incidents—not just the IT team. Much like digitalisation and customer- centricity have evolved from isolated initiatives to organisation-wide imperatives, cybersecurity must follow the same path to maturity. This evolution involves continuous training, clear communication, and integrating cybersecurity into business decisions rather than treating it as a separate technical concern. Ultimately, cyber resilience thrives when security becomes a shared responsibility embedded into daily operations and decision-making across an organisation. 42% of organisations reported phishing and social engineering attacks in 2024 1 90% of organisations expect an increase in cyberattacks this year in terms of volume, costliness, or both 2 29% of organisations reported that they had been materially affected by a cyber incident in the past 12 months 3 1 https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-cybersecurity-outlook-2025/digest/ 2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/navigating-cybersecurity-investments-in-the-time-of-nis-2 3 https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-cybersecurity-outlook-2024/ 4 https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/quicksight/check-point/the-worlds-third-largest-economy-has-bad-intentions-and-its-only-getting-bigger 5 4 The importance of continuous and iterative cybersecurity: The WannaCry cyberattack Resilience is a sign of maturity in an organisation. Robust organisations have pivoted from the misguided notion of outright prevention to a focus on resilience—the “when, not if” mentality. Those same organisations understand that a high wall is never enough; a plan must be developed, implemented, and tested for when an organisation is breached, but a real plan, not just a token one. On May 12, 2017, the world witnessed one of the gravest ransomware attacks in history—WannaCry. This self-propagating ransomware worm exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows called EternalBlue, a leaked exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The attack spread rapidly across the globe, encrypting files on infected systems and demanding $300 in Bitcoin for decryption, doubling if payment wasn’t made within three days. Within hours, WannaCry had infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, telecom companies, and government agencies were among the hardest hit. The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) suffered massive disruptions with up to 70,000 affected devices, from MRI scanners to operating theatres, forcing hospitals to cancel surgeries and turn away patients. FedEx, Boeing, Deutsche Bahn, and many automotive manufacturers were also affected. Organisations faced severe consequences: financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. The global cost is estimated at between €4 and €8 billion. 4 Despite its scale, WannaCry could have been prevented. Microsoft had released a security patch (MS17-010) two months prior, but many organisations, for one reason or another, had yet to update their systems. Beyond patching, a comprehensive resilience approach—including initiatives such as proper governance, network segmentation, endpoint detection, backup strategies, incident response planning, and employee awareness—would have significantly reduced the impact. A major turning point came when a security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, accidentally discovered a ‘kill switch,’ a hardcoded domain that, when registered, stopped WannaCry’s spread. While this fortunate discovery helped contain the initial outbreak, variants without this kill switch later emerged. This evolution demonstrates that reliance on reactive, one-time solutions is inherently risky. Had organisations implemented a culture of resilience rather than depending on emergency interventions, they would have been better positioned against both the original attack and its variants. The WannaCry saga ultimately proves that cyber resilience requires systematic, proactive approaches rather than hoping for last-minute rescues. 7 Token efforts vs. business benefit Despite the clear risk, many, if not most, companies are not acting with sincerity in the face of growing cyberattacks. Token efforts are the norm. There are two key indicators of such superficial approaches: First, companies that lack a senior business leader who champions cybersecurity at the executive level. While formal structures may vary, the absence of C-suite advocacy and accountability—whether through a dedicated information security board or direct representation in leadership meetings— signals that security isn’t truly embedded in business strategy. The second indicator is inadequate risk management: either cyber risks are absent from operational risk registers entirely, or they exist merely as generic entries without proper classification, regular updates, or specific mitigation plans. Simply having “cyber” listed on a risk register without corresponding awareness campaigns and training for all employees reveals a disconnect between acknowledged risks and meaningful action. To some extent, this is understandable; the market demands we “move fast,” forcing us into a constant race to deliver products and services quickly. This urgency often relegates security to secondary importance due to the misconception that it impedes speed and agility. When security isn’t integrated from the beginning as part of the design process, it becomes a bottleneck, requiring expensive rework and retroactive changes. What’s ironic is that secure-by-design products actually serve as powerful market differentiators in today’s landscape, where consumers increasingly value the protection of their data and privacy. Take AI, for example. If a proven-secure AI product existed, that would be a market differentiator. Imagine a self-driving car with engineered resilience in data protection and also in servicing the vehicle and in customer relationships. But this does not exist. The era of “tech” businesses and “non-tech” businesses has passed. When everyone and everything is connected to the internet, everyone and everything has an attack vector. So, everything today is a tech business, making data breaches a business problem, not a technology issue. Yet this view has not yet been universally accepted in organisational cultures, and cyber resilience is often the victim of budget restraints and/or cuts. Given the difficulty of demonstrating true value and ROI regarding cyber resilience and security, it is still too often seen as a tradeable commodity, a hindrance instead of an enabler. But it does not have to be this way. Business benefit defined Quantifying the ROI on an investment in cyber resilience is challenging but not impossible. While traditional financial metrics may struggle to capture the full value of resilience measures, organisations can develop meaningful frameworks to assess both direct and indirect returns. This is especially true as the business value of cyber resilience extends beyond simply avoiding costs, encompassing regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust, all of which contribute to measurable outcomes when adequately evaluated. With the right approach, cyber investments can demonstrate clear value, even if that value takes multiple forms. Take, for example, the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act. While the CRA is not applicable in the United States or the United Kingdom, these countries have, or soon will, their own fundamentally similar 1 legislation—a mandated cyber resilience requirement to do business within their territory. So, one quantifiable return on cyber resilience is the very ability to operate in those markets. A second quantifiable benefit is reduced spending on incident response and recovery. For example, in 2024, the average cost of a data breach was €4.66 million, and the average cost of a malicious insider attack was €4.76 million, according to IBM’s Cost of Data Breach Report. 1 https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=12363882-4860-4e64-944c-3c5be3e327ab 9 1 https://nortal.com/insights/creating-trust-digital-government/ Nortal trust formula: Trust = reliability x fairness x transparency ± execution However, Accenture’s research shows that those who prioritize cyber investments experience up to three times lower cyber breach costs than their peers.

Adopting the “when, not if” mindset ensures that organisations are prepared to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats with minimal disruption. Resilience is not a one-time investment but an ongoing commitment—requiring continuous monitoring, training, and adaptation to remain effective. By embedding cyber resilience into daily operations and long-term planning, organisations can mitigate damage, maintain trust, safeguard business continuity, and save money. In an era where cyber threats are inevitable, true resilience lies in a culture of resilience-by-design thinking.

    "content": "Article January 15, 2026 by Jukka Kostiainen, Value Architect, Nortal Finland Moving the data discussion from the engine room to the boardroom The secrets of successful C suite leaders. Service Data and AI Industry Industry Manufacturing Today, the industrial companies that thrive are those that shift from hindsight to foresight, leveraging real-time data and AI to spot potential disruptions early, enhance energy efficiency, and allocate resources where they’re needed most – before bottlenecks occur. Real-time data is no longer just a technical detail, but a boardroom priority: the catalyst for AI innovation and a key driver of both resilience and long‑term competitive strength. As a CEO or C‑level executive, the question isn’t whether to invest in your company’s data foundation, but how to lead the organization to become truly data-driven. To excel, one must champion data-driven decision-making at every level – from the engine room to the boardroom. In this article, we share best practices learned from executive leaders setting the benchmark among our customers. These insights may resonate with any leader tasked with putting data at the center of their company’s business. The executive leaders’ role in data: bridging strategy and execution In our previous article, “Real-time data + real AI = real solutions to factory floor problems,” we explained why combining real-time data with AI-powered analytics is a game-changer for industrial companies. Together, real-time data and AI unlock transformative efficiencies by turning yesterday’s reports into actionable foresight: from optimizing logistics to preventing costly equipment failures. These are business opportunities that directly impact company’s profitability and competitiveness. While working with clients on data foundations and the shift to real-time data and analytics, we’ve noticed several common patterns among successful executive leaders. These patterns reveal what makes a data strategy succeed – and they might surprise you. Here are four things that set the most effective leaders apart. Next, we will take a closer look at each of these elements and unpack what they mean in practice. #1 Start with why and how data pays off In working with organizations across industries, one consistent lesson is that successful data-driven transformation begins with clarity of purpose rather than technology. The leaders that excel in data‑driven transformation create a data and technology vision rooted in business strategy. If your strategy centers on margin protection, sustainability, or customer experience, data initiatives must align with those priorities. This alignment ensures every euro invested supports the business, not just technology modernization. Digitalization should be treated as a strategic asset. Like any asset, it requires disciplined investment and must ultimately generate shareholder value. A strong business case for a data foundation is invaluable yet often overlooked. Too often, the focus is on implementation and capabilities, while the assessment of value creation, especially long-term profitability, is neglected. If an organization lacks a standardized investment evaluation model, the minimum requirement should be to calculate the return on investment (ROI) for the data foundation. ROI is an intuitive and straightforward measure of investment efficiency, but it comes with clear limitations. It ignores cash flow timing, can be misleading for long-term initiatives, and does not reflect absolute value creation. Net Present Value (NPV) offers a more robust basis for decision-making. By considering the timing of cash flows and the cost of capital, NPV directly aligns with shareholder value creation. However, NPV is also more complex and sensitive to assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. Many organizations struggle to clarify the opportunities within data foundations. That’s why we work closely with business owners to calculate returns and uncover hidden costs before making technology decisions. The value of a strong data foundation and data-driven business typically falls into three categories: A) Growth: Structured, real-time data unlocks new revenue streams and innovative business models. B) Risk mitigation: Up-to-date, synchronized data supports compliance and strengthens resilience. C) Efficiency: A modern, fit-for-purpose technology foundation harmonizes technology architecture and reduces costs associated with legacy systems. The executive leaders who succeed in data‑driven transformation invest time and effort in communicating the data vision and business case — anchored in the company’s strategy — in ways that inspire the entire leadership team. Data-driven transformation isn’t confined to a single function; it changes how the whole company operates and requires commitment from all members of the leadership team. Just as it is crucial for executive leaders to engage and commit the leadership team, it is equally important to keep the board of directors informed about the data transformation. Building a competitive business strategy is a core responsibility of the board, so they must understand how data supports strategic priorities. In these discussions, leaders are better equipped when they have a solid, grounded business case to support their data-driven rationale. #2 Draw the use case roadmap and rigorously monitor progress Once the vision is clear and backed by robust numbers from the business case, the executive leaders who succeed in data‑driven transformation ensure their teams have a strong grasp of the most compelling use cases for the data platform. As we noted in our previous article , generative AI can sometimes seem like a hammer seeking nails. However, the most valuable industrial use cases for data and AI often emerge in areas like machine learning and other real-time analytics applications. As the world transitions from digital to post-digital, our methods of measuring success must also evolve. While traditional long-term metrics like ROI and NPV remain vital for assessing digital investments, they are fundamentally lagging indicators – reflecting past outcomes. A post-digital mindset requires looking ahead, not behind. To manage and optimize value creation in real time, organizations need to break down high-level KPIs and deeply understand how value is generated throughout the operation, down to the shop floor. This approach enables timely course corrections and more informed decision-making. Teams can then use these insights to refine their roadmap, nurture value, and scale successful practices into enterprise-wide capabilities. One of our customers’ executives exemplifies this shift by monitoring energy consumption and costs in real time to track the day-to-day evolution of the profitability of digital investments. At the shop-floor level, KPIs become even more concrete, for example, measuring the percentage of time optimized setpoints are applied in the production process. These operational indicators provide early signals of digital solutions adoption and whether their value potential is being realized. This is the essence of post-digital leadership: not just deploying technology, but orchestrating value. It is also at the heart of how we can support industrial leaders. We combine deep technological expertise with a strong understanding of industrial processes and business models, enabling organizations to connect strategic financial outcomes with operational execution and real-time performance management. Discover how we can help you leverage Microsoft Fabric for real-time, compliant data See how we unify your data with Microsoft Fabric #3 Technology pilots come first, scale follows later Technology should enter the conversation only after the vision and expected outcomes are clearly defined. Ultimately, the goal is not to buy tools, but to enable capabilities that deliver business value. When the entire leadership team is aligned on the vision, the business case, and the initial use cases, selecting the right technology stack is based on facts, not beliefs. Modern platforms like Microsoft Fabric enable organizations to unify operational and analytical data, generate real-time insights, and scale across the enterprise. However, even the best technology will fail without a pragmatic, stepwise approach. In our experience, the most successful organizations begin with a few high-impact pilots, run them in short cycles, and measure and communicate results. They then use the learnings to refine their technical architecture and integrations, organizational capabilities, processes, and their operating model before scaling. This approach reduces risk and accelerates time-to-value. #4 Empower your people to power the transformation Technology alone does not transform a business – people do. Change management is often underestimated, yet it is the single most significant factor in realizing value. Organizations must be prepared to use data in decision-making. Executive leaders who excel in data‑driven transformation recognize the need to train teams, redefine roles, and embed new routines, and allocate the time and resources required to put them into practice. Preparing the organization for the transformation also means fostering a culture that shifts from reactive firefighting to proactive planning. Without this investment in people, even the most advanced solutions will underperform. Real-time data and data-driven transformation are no longer optional – they are the foundation for resilience and growth in modern industrial environments. Executive leaders and teams that succeed don’t treat data as an IT upgrade but as a strategic asset. They start with vision, build a solid business case, and lead their people – at both the operational and board levels – through change with confidence.

    "title": "Woikoski’s digital leap: real-time manufacturing built on industrial heritage",
    "content": "Case study January 12, 2026 Woikoski’s digital leap: real-time manufacturing built on industrial heritage Woikoski is a fourthgeneration Finnish industrial company. Founded in 1882, it has evolved into a modern provider of industrial, medical, and welding gases. Today, the company is advancing toward data-driven, real-time operations and a modern digital factory, beginning with a pilot at the Kokkola plant as part of Woikoski’s business digitalization initiative. Service Data and AI Industry Industry Manufacturing The digital initiative has been driven by Woikoski’s CEO and CIO from the outset, ensuring strong executive sponsorship and sustained leadership commitment. Microsoft introduced Nortal as a trusted partner for production digitalization, and together with the Woikoski and Nortal teams, has developed a long-term roadmap. This plan includes a designfirst pilot, a shared governance and operating model, and a modern data platform with realtime analytics powered by Microsoft Fabric. Objective: real-time and proactive insights to spark action From the outset, Woikoski defined two primary objectives: to make factory-floor and equipment data easily accessible to leaders and operators, and to shift from retrospective reporting to real-time, data-driven decision-making. These goals were intended to unlock new opportunities that strengthen performance and support sustainable growth across the organization. In seeking a partner with deep experience in industrial digitalization programs, Woikoski was introduced to Nortal by Microsoft. The collaboration between Woikoski and Nortal began with a comprehensive assessment of Woikoski’s existing data and solutions, evaluating organizational and technical readiness, and designing a pilot project to validate the approach. “We started with the business vision, roles, and governance, and then supported Woikoski to select the tech to fit. This consultationfirst approach, distinctive to Nortal, gave Woikoski a scalable foundation that is in line with Woikoski’s business and IT strategies, instead of a oneoff technology project,” explains J ukka Kostiainen , Nortal’s Value Architect. Leadership commitment from strategy to execution The three pillars at the core of the Woikoski and Nortal collaboration are: A digital strategy for operations, strongly endorsed by Woikoski’s top leadership, consisting of a shared vision for digital manufacturing and a practical, long-term roadmap. A digital operating and governance model designed to break down silos, enable end-to-end process thinking, and provide clear, transparent KPIs for better business oversight. The Kokkola pilot with Microsoft Fabric & realtime analytics, to demonstrate what digitalization will mean in practice to Woikoski in terms of competencies, organization, technology, and execution. As a first step, the team delivered a small OT data platform pilot on Microsoft Fabric, establishing a foundation for future data products across production, energy, and finance. This pilot enables secure cloud-based data transfer and lays the groundwork for developing reporting tools such as Power BI, as well as a governance model for managing and sharing information across the organization. Single real-time view and predictions drive efficiency and customer satisfaction Collaboration with Nortal is bringing a new level of transparency and efficiency to Woikoski’s operations. Data from six to seven different sources now flows into a single, unified system, providing both management and plant teams with a real-time view of the entire site. This replaces the previous reliance on manual data collection from multiple systems or even physical visits to the control room, making daily production management smoother and providing a comprehensive view that wasn’t previously possible. Teija Hölttä, CIO, Woikoski “Microsoft Fabric and real-time analytics allowed us to deliver results quickly, while also building a solid foundation for the future. The Kokkola pilot marked an important step towards greater transparency in operations, laying the foundation for future predictive capabilities and, ultimately, our long-term vision of an autonomous factory.” The business benefits are already evident at the Kokkola factory. While Woikoski is still in the early stages of its digital journey, the potential impact is substantial — especially in improving the ability to predict major process failures, helping to avoid costly disruptions and optimize performance. Maintenance activities can now be planned with far greater precision. For example, oil top-ups are performed at the optimal moment when equipment is operating at full power, an action that previously required the control room but can now be verified on a tablet directly at the machine. Real-time dashboards and shared KPIs accelerate decision-making, while a unified data foundation simplifies operational leadership for both factory and production managers. Kari Salovaara, CFO, Woikoski “Avoiding just one major compressor failure could cover the entire cost of the pilot investment in predictive maintenance capabilities.” One of the most significant breakthroughs has been the move toward predictive maintenance, particularly for critical equipment such as air-gas compressors. These large, specialized assets rely on costly spare parts with long delivery times, and unexpected shortages can delay production while the correct parts are sourced. With real-time monitoring and early warning indicators in place, maintenance can now be planned proactively, and spare parts ordered well before failures occur, helping to prevent costly breakdowns and unplanned downtime.

    "content": "Article January 7, 2026 by Ergin Tuganay, Head of Data & AI, Nortal Finland From gut feelings to data leadership Machine and process whisperers leave a void only technology can fill. Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Data and AI One ordinary day, Paul notices an alert: the production line has unexpectedly shut down. The issue is serious, and no one saw it coming. Except one person might have. Just a week earlier, Martin, the factory’s chief maintenance engineer, retired after decades of service. When Martin walked out the door for the last time, the company lost something Paul hadn’t even realized they possessed: the silent knowledge of a “Machine Whisperer.” After countless years on the factory floor, Martin had come to know everything about the site and its equipment. He could sense and interpret the equipment’s inner workings – almost their very souls – using only his experience and intuition. Armed with these skills, Martin could predict how the facility would behave in the coming hours without even consulting the data from the factory’s many sensors. Whisperers like Martin are present in most organizations, and yours is likely no exception. Replacing unbeatable experience with data and technology Across nearly every industry, workplaces are facing a pressing reality: workers in maintenance, operations, and customer-facing roles are aging, and experienced workers are retiring in large numbers. We are losing the Machine, Process, and People Whisperers – those who have been silently keeping things running smoothly. The knowledge gap exists because these roles require years of hands-on experience, and there simply aren’t enough new experts entering the field to replace them. Simultaneously, businesses are drowning in fragmented data from tools of varying age and maturity, struggling to turn it into usable insights and foresights. The cumulative impact of these two trends is creating inefficiencies that hinder operations and drive costs upward. If you believe this won’t impact your business, think again. In many sectors, from production and maintenance to healthcare and professional services, productivity increases with experience. As senior experts retire, organizations across industries will lose invaluable know-how and will need to adapt to a new reality. Consider the energy sector: when senior engineers retire, they take with them critical knowledge of grid stability that supports predictive maintenance. In finance and insurance, experienced analysts and claims specialists hold extensive expertise in complex, often undocumented processes. In public administration, the departure of seasoned experts results in the loss of crucial insights needed to design effective digital services – especially for an aging population. The pattern repeats across sectors. An institutional and tacit knowledge about processes and key decision-making is lost, continuity and efficiency are put at risk across every industry. “Oil” worth 550 billion euros locked in silos across the EU In today’s digital economy, the phrase “data is the new oil” rings truer than ever. The knowledge held by Machine and Process Whisperers translates directly into profitability and significant opportunities for new revenue streams. In Europe alone, the data economy was valued at €325B entering the 2020s, accounting for 2.6% of EU GDP. This figure is projected to reach €550B by the end of 2025, nearly doubling the value of the EU data business in just five years. However, fragmented systems and the retirement of Whisperers mean companies cannot unlock this value. Organizations unable to convert Whisperers’ knowledge into measurable, actionable data will struggle to succeed. They risk losing clients, revenue, and profit to competitors – or going out of business sooner rather than later. Although innovative digital solutions, such as AI-driven replacements for the Whisperers, have advanced considerably recently, familiar difficulties remain. Organizations struggle with siloed systems block a holistic view of operations. Most solutions in use offer limited scalability and experience performance bottlenecks. The absence of real-time analytics delays decision-making, leaving us to sail in today’s winds while watching yesterday’s waves. Connecting the data dots Beyond data access, another foundational barrier to actionable insights is limited data connectivity. The complexity and high cost of integrating disparate tools and platforms also further introduce security and compliance risks. A connected enterprise, in turn, allows streamlined communication across people, equipment, and devices; delivers up-to-the-minute insights that drive optimization; and supports faster, smarter AI-powered decisions. Nortal partnered with Valmet to overcome these challenges by creating a truly connected enterprise. At a new production site, equipment malfunctions were generating excessive waste, impacting profitability and sustainability. The root cause was fragmented data across multiple automation systems from different vendors, each with its own interface and siloed information. Daily reporting required significant manual effort, slowing down corrective actions. By integrating these systems and leveraging existing data, Valmet gained continuous operational insight that enabled faster decisions and drove cost reductions, ultimately enhancing efficiency across the site. The challenges observed in manufacturing reflect a broader, cross-industry issue. In energy, fragmented systems make it difficult to assess grid status and enable predictive maintenance. In finance and insurance, integrating legacy systems remains costly and slows risk and compliance processes. Public administration grapples with siloed data that impedes effective decisions and service optimization, frustrating both officials and citizens. Healthcare faces similar challenges, including scattered patient records that complicate care coordination and real-time analytics. In every sector, the challenge is not a lack of data, but an absence of a unified, intelligent approach to connect and utilize it. A unified platform to sense what’s next As our industrial customer demonstrates, there is good news: the challenges of retiring experts, fragmented systems, and unstructured data are solvable, regardless of what industry you operate in. The solution lies in transforming these disconnected elements into a unified, intelligent data ecosystem. This is where Microsoft Fabric comes into play. Microsoft Fabric is more than just another data tool. It is a comprehensive SaaS data platform built for modern enterprises in any industry. By unifying data engineering, analytics, and AI into a single seamless solution, it eliminates the complexity of managing multiple tools and vendors. At its heart is OneLake, a secure, unified data foundation that breaks down silos and ensures organization-wide accessibility. For “the Pauls” in any business, Microsoft Fabric fills the void left by “the Martins”: it offers scalable, cost-efficient data operations; real-time analytics for faster decision-making; and an AI-ready architecture that extends beyond reporting to enable predictions, automation, and proactive insights – just like Martin once did. Fabric’s integrated governance ensures security and compliance without hindering innovation, while IT/OT (Information Technology/Operational Technology) convergence enables connected facilities and eliminates unplanned downtime. For companies facing talent shortages and increasing complexity, Fabric provides the foundation for a future-proof data strategy. Discover how we can help you leverage Microsoft Fabric for real-time, compliant data See how we unify your data with Microsoft Fabric The roadmap to data success We consistently observe measurable results when our clients implement a unified data platform: reduced downtime, improved yield, and accelerated innovation. The journey begins with a holistic data strategy - one that breaks silos and enables real-time analytics. This is supported by a unified digital innovation platform such as Microsoft Fabric, which integrates data engineering, analytics, and AI to enable connectivity, collaboration, and digital twins of critical assets - from factories and facilities to the indispensable “Martins.” With this foundation, processes can adapt automatically to changing conditions, delivering zero unplanned downtime across industries. Equally essential is the integration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), ensuring operational and business data converge into a single, actionable whole. At the same time, the era of relying on gut feelings and decades of tacit experience is coming to an end. As Machine, Process, and People Whisperers retire, organizations face a clear choice: let critical institutional knowledge disappear or transform it into actionable intelligence. Those who succeed will capture and scale this silent knowledge and amplify it through data. Microsoft Fabric provides the foundation for this transformation. Paired with expert guidance from partners like our specialists at Nortal it enables seamless implementation and measurable results. Future competitive advantage will stem not from intuition and experience alone, but from turning tacit knowledge into data-driven foresight.

From an economic standpoint, high trust leads to institutional effectiveness and progress. Policies that increase effectiveness typically also yield higher trust and vice versa. Yet most governments struggle with trust. In the private sector, trust is self-regulating – if customers do not trust a company, that company eventually loses its customers. But democracies suffering from low trust mostly suffer from inhibited growth and political instability that leads to limited progress on technological adoption and social development. This report highlights research into increasing trust, with a focus on technological approaches in the public sector that enable governments to increase effectiveness and trust. Our key recommendations are: 1. Adopt modern service delivery channels to deliver end-to-end outcomes over fractured user experience. Invest in secure building digital public infrastructure to enable a higher maturity level of services. 2. Establish clear rules in data ownership, legitimate use of personal data by institutions, data protection and rules that make physical and digital transactions and services legally equal. Provide clear interpretation of rules. 3. Create services that enable real-time transparency concerning the use of personal data. Adopt mechanisms such as targeted transparency to increase voluntary compliance. 4. Ensure continuous small improvements in public service delivery over large reforms. Create procurement rules to enforce the mechanism. Utilize incentives and nudging strategies to shift users towards higher levels of voluntary compliance over time. All these recommendations can be implemented in the federal, state, local government, or organization context. This report aims to provide a simple thinking model for civil servants at all levels that can be factored into policymaking, technical improvements, and practical delivery of public services. What is trust? Trust is our willingness to be exposed to another party’s actions on something that is important to us, without being able to control or monitor that other party. In other words, trust means relying on something beneficial getting done for us without being able to fully control it. Something becomes trustworthy when we can rely on it to perform consistently in that manner. Definition of trust 7 To understand trust, we must understand the human nature. Few examples of presumptions and emotions that influence trust in governments. Always late” Negativity bias – The train might be late sometimes, but feels like always The rich will always get away with it” E.g., public scandals revealing tax avoidance I believe what I can see for myself” Human nature is to distrust things we cannot experience ourselves They take our jobs” Human nature is to distrust what we don’t fully understand Trust and effectiveness Research shows that high trust leads to policy effectiveness. The specific mechanism is voluntary compliance, which is especially valuable for government functions that would otherwise resort to enforcement by intrusion (see Figure 1). Kenneth Arrow, the Nobel Prize winner in economics in 1972 and one of the great welfare economists of the 20th century, is often quoted when economists discuss trust. Arrow says that “virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust … it can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence” (Arrow 1972). Empirical evidence for his claim is plentiful. High-trust communities are better off economically as trust enables more economic transactions while reducing the need for elaborate compliance and control mechanisms. This holds for global (e.g., Algan & Cahuc 2014) and within- country comparisons (Guiso et al. 2004). In fact, the evidence is strong enough to warrant claims that overall “welfare returns to investing in trust could be substantial” (Hamilton et al. 2016). Hence, we can view trust as purely functional – it is an efficient enabler of social and economic transactions. It also follows that trust leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains when implementing policies or building services because citizens voluntarily change their behavior in ways that are more likely to bring about the desired policy outcome.

A firefighter, saving your life, or a tax inspector? The Rescue Board and the Tax and Customs Board are among Estonia’s highest trusted public services. Figure 2. Trust of Institutions, 4th quarter 2023.

Not because one rescues you from a burning building and the other takes your hard-earned tax dollars. But because they agree that they both do the right thing. The reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, however. Value from service goal The opinion on the fire rescue service is, in essence, a valence issue; there is a social consensus that coming to the rescue is the right thing to do. If you add the reliability of coming to the rescue you have the winning formula and trust emerges. It is a good thing that is being done reliably. It means one can trust the fire service because it is a good thing done right. Figure 3. VAT compliance gap by Member State (as % of VTTL, 2020 vs 2021).

In fact, given the choice to pay taxes or not while keeping everything else constant, an overwhelming majority of us would choose not to pay taxes at all (Mascagni 2018). But a position issue can be turned into a valence issue by how a service is organized. One might disagree with taxes but agree that if tax is needed, it should be done as simply as possible. And equally, a person who thinks taxes are good and necessary to organize societal functioning will agree with an anti-tax advocate that paying taxes should be simple. The organizing principle will override the animosity of my anti-tax position. It means one trusts the tax service because they do an unpleasant thing right. Value from mode of service delivery The more paradoxical example is with the tax administration. The Estonian Tax and Customs Board is one of the most trusted public institutions in Estonia, and at the same time has one of the highest collection efficiencies in the European Union (Figure 3). This dynamic well demonstrates the correlation between trust and effectiveness. 11 Trust as both enabler and dependency The paradox of digital transformation – trust is needed to invest public capital in digital transformation, and at the same time, digital transformation will result in trust. It is both an outcome of the process and a necessary precondition for it. But such a virtuous cycle, where the initial trust level enables a digital service uptake and the usage of the same services starts to increase, trust can only be kickstarted when the initial trust level is there. So, building trust to a level when the positive dynamic sets in is a very practical question. From a certain level of digital maturity onward – like moving from traditional e-government to personal government – trust becomes a core enabler of governance as citizen willingness to share their data is a technical necessity of the system. Figure 4. Source: Personal Government - a vision for a post-digital era of equitable and sustainable public services (2023). https://www.personalgovernment.com/personal-government-white-paper In the following chapter we explore what are the means to create trust by analyzing the components of trust. Formula on trust Trust has been researched at length. One would be hard-pressed to identify a domain of society where trust has not been explored. It is safe to say that collectively we know a great deal about trust. Be it on interpersonal and generalized trust (see Dinesen, Thisted & Bekkers 2017, Rotenberg 2020), trust and personal well-being (see Zhao 2024), trust and economic efficiency (Coyle & Lu 2020), trust in business relationships (Castaldo 2010), trust and digitalization of the public service (Lim & Thing 2024), trust in AI (Lukyanenko et al., 2022, Benk et al., 2024), trust in politics (Levi & Stoker 2000, Uslaner 2018), and governments (Chanley 2000), trust in organizations (Lane 1998), institutions (Berg et al 2020) and international institutions (Torgler 2008). Furthermore, all those empirical studies are built on an impressive array of theories on what is trust (Möllering 2001, Lane 2001), how it is built (Fadillah & Huiquan 2024), what are its primary reference objects and how asymmetric trust is (Venegas 2018), and of course, how trust should be researched (Hendriks et al., 2021). All of these details have increased our knowledge of trust a lot, but they have also obscured some basic truths that those studies implicitly share. What emerges from all those extremely detailed and illuminating empirical and theoretical examinations of trust in different contexts is a certain thin red line they all agree on. And this fine line connects directly to the fundamental definition of trust we outlined earlier: trust occurs when we receive what we expect (reliability), accept that it is what we deserved (fairness), and can, at least theoretically, verify that it is so (transparency). When examining specific theoretical attributes of trust, especially the well-known asymmetry principle, we should also note that the manner in which all of this is delivered (execution) matters. The trust formula, therefore, is as follows: Trust = reliability × fairness × transparency ± execution The first three elements are necessary conditions, hence their multiplication. If one is zero, then growing the others won’t really help. Execution is also essential, and it can either increase or decrease trust, depending on its nature. The following sections will explain the elements of the formula in detail. 13 Figure 5. Components of trust formula mapped and plotted on OECD Trust Survey 2024. Satisfaction with services that provide outcomes has by far the most impact on trust and positive perception. Simply providing information online (fractured experience) does not significantly improve trust. Source: OECD Survey on Drivers of Trust in Public Institutions – 2024 Results https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-survey-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-2024-results_9a20554b-en.html Reliability Fairness Transparency Execution Reliability, fairness, and transparency in public services are shown to have the most substantial impact on trust, as highlighted in the following chart. Reliability Continuing with the earlier examples, we can summarize that one trusts the fire rescue service because it does a good thing and is reliable in doing so – the very definition of trust. One trusts the tax authority, and while they may impose an obligation, they do so in a way that is fast and easy and non-demanding of one’s time and resources. Tax reporting, like any form of reporting and oversight, represents inefficiency because it becomes necessary only in the absence of trust. If an excellent taxing service were provided, we would trust it. In the case of fire rescue, the service goal is of inherent value for us and the means of delivering it is reliable – trust emerges. In the case of taxing, the service goal is not of intrinsic value to us, but it is done right and reliably – trust emerges. We hence have the first necessary element for trust: reliability of delivery. Something becomes trustworthy when we can rely on it to perform consistently in the desired manner. The examples also show that reliability can come through the inherent value of the service goal to the client (like rescue) or through how the service is organized (like pre-filled tax reports, where the effort of reporting taxes is minimized or eliminated). In both cases, the outcome of the service will have to be delivered at a highly consistent rate every time. The argument for mature digital services is commonly related to their reliability over traditional alternatives. Digital services, at their best maturity levels, offer outcomes in real-time, often proactively. If implemented right, they tend to significantly increase efficiency both for the citizens and the administration. Statistically, the most impactful modifier for creating reliability for digital services is the user experience. Digital services can be accessed through cost-efficient devices that most people carry with them – such as mobile phones and other personal devices. The key difficulty, however, derives from establishing policies such as a once-only principle and implementing secure digital public infrastructure (especially digital registries, digital identity, and secure data exchange) to enable service delivery at higher maturity levels. Nations that have invested in those areas are consistently rewarded with high satisfaction and trust in public services in various international rankings, such as European e-Government Benchmark or United Nations e-Government Survey. Survey data on citizens further reiterates this. The OECD Trust Survey shows consistently over years and jurisdictions that service reliability, especially end-to-end delivery of outcomes, outperforms other factors that increase trust. It may seem unconventional; however, the data indicates that citizens prioritize service reliability far more than their participation in the delivery process or service design phase. This helps of course as well, but participation and consultations do not scale effectively and are significantly outperformed by the value seen in high service reliability. 15 Key recommendations: 1. Prioritize services that deliver end-to-end outcomes instead of fractured experience. Fractured experience implies that the user needs to, for example, call a helpdesk or wait until a civil servant processes the application manually. 2. Adopt modern service delivery channels. Invest in modern, accessible, and affordable service delivery channels. Switch to mobile channels as a policy in digital service delivery. 3. Build digital public infrastructure. Invest in digital public infrastructure (especially digital registries, digital identity, and secure data exchange) to enable high-maturity digital public service delivery. Transparency Trust, by definition, is needed when control isn’t possible. If complete control were achievable, trust wouldn’t be necessary. However, relying solely on trust can leave us in a vulnerable position. When control is limited, we need accountability mechanisms if trust breaks down or is misplaced. One of the most effective mechanisms is transparency. After all, a “black box” is only as reliable as it is transparent. When we want control, we should have the option to exercise it. While 99% of people who trust may not want to or have the time to monitor every detail – that’s why they trust in the first place – the vocal 1% who do take the time perform an important role in ensuring accountability. This is why the option to control should exist, with transparency built into the service infrastructure to support it. In Estonia, all citizens can see in real-time who has accessed their data using a public digital service called the Data Tracker. Built on top of the national data exchange system as part of the public digital infrastructure, this service provides citizens with both assurance and the means to hold public service providers accountable for the legitimate use of their data. Targeted transparency is another, more promising method, where specific disclosures are used to achieve objectives (Weil et al., 2013). For instance, publishing information on tax debts or taxes paid has been shown to positively influence voluntary compliance. Other ways to enhance transparency include publishing open data and allowing citizens to generate insights and draw their own conclusions. For this to be impactful, open data services must ensure that information is easily accessible and machine-readable. This method not only increases transparency but also enhances data quality by expanding the number of consumers of the data. The problem is that such services, like providing open data in repositories, are often not useful for the regular 99% of citizens who lack the skill to process raw data, and in worst cases, they become simple dead data dumps. It is much more preferable to have automated transparency reports generated every time someone requests data on a citizen from a database or when service exchange personal data, like is done by the Data Tracker application in Estonia. This makes transparency effectively possible and gives a simple tool to exercise the right to one’s own data. 17 Key recommendations: 1. Regulate data ownership. Clarify who owns what data and outline citizens’ rights and public sector rights regarding the use of that data. 2. Create real-time transparency in personal data usage. We recommend creating a system that cannot be circumvented and gives citizens transparency regarding which authorities access their personal data and when. Although this service can be developed independently by any authority offering digital public services, it would be more effective to centralize this function and provide it as part of a national digital public infrastructure in the long run. 3. Assure public access to data. Make it easy to access data in registries. Make information available with specific targeted intent to increase voluntary compliance. Fairness Fairness ranks systematically medium-high in surveys as a key driver for trust. If a service delivery breaks the citizens’ sense of justice or fairness, people tend to find ways to avoid it, reducing adoption and voluntary compliance. Discrimination has often been surveyed as a major source of distrust in institutions globally. A study on requests for information about unemployment benefits found that ethnic minorities received significantly lower-quality information (Hemker & Rink 2017). Another study found that minorities often encounter greater challenges when seeking information on voter registration (White et al., 2015). And research indicates that ethnic minority clients at unemployment agencies are penalized more frequently for policy violations compared to ethnic majority clients (Pedersen et al., 2018. Discrimination is a human intent and action. Inconsistency in decision-making and following self-imposed or administrative rules is also very human. Though law prohibits discrimination, the very people implementing the law tend to be inconsistent in following it (Kahneman et al., 2016). Algorithms, however, do not discriminate unless made to do so. They are also highly consistent when used on good quality data. We argue that in digital service delivery and transparency of the decision- making, algorithms and rules reduce discrimination by reducing room for individual inconsistency. With proper technically enforced transparency and accountability rules algorithms do a fairer job. Key recommendations: 1. Identify discrimination and levels of unfairness in public service delivery and prioritize digitalization and transparency in algorithms accordingly. 2. Create clarity in rules and regulations. Rules are more efficient when they are clear and do not require debate (thus inducing costs) in interpretation. We recommend clearly communicating the rules, algorithms, and principles related to digital public service delivery. Figure 6. A simplification of key areas to regulate and clearly communicate in digital governance and service delivery across various levels of state governance. 19 Execution How we implement and execute public service delivery contributes to overall trust. We view execution not as a multiplier of trust but as an additive factor. While poor implementation may not completely erase trust, it can significantly lower it or enhance it. Recent research in risk perception has reported a “negativity bias” for risk-related information (White et al., 2003). Specifically, “negative” messages that indicate the presence of risk are believed to be more trusted and have a greater impact on risk perceptions than “positive” messages that suggest the absence of risk. This implies that trust is asymmetrical – it is easier to destroy than to create. Additionally, smaller positive events tend to have a more significant effect on overall trust than fewer larger events. In practice, larger reforms have a less positive impact on trust than continuous smaller improvements. This suggests citizens value consistent small improvements more than infrequent but significant reforms. In Estonia, most public procurement related to developing digital public services and infrastructure is structured by funding policies that require projects to be broken down into smaller, more manageable projects with observable outcomes. Large digital services and infrastructure programs are executed under frame agreements with competing vendors and divided into manageable chunks (typically around 500,000 EUR). This approach has led to better risk management and resulted in significantly faster observable progress at a lower cost. Creating trust is a constant and gradual process. Not all services can be transformed into high-trust equivalents solely through technical means. Creating trust takes time, and strategies that foster trust have proven effective. Service delivery should include ways to nudge users toward higher levels of trust. For example, while a digital tax filing service with a pre-filing option might be available, it requires users to trust the tax authority with their data. A nudging strategy could involve transitioning users from a basic service to a more advanced one through voluntary means, such as offering incentives like faster processing times in exchange for sharing personal data. Figure 7. Trust asymmetry in action 21 Key recommendations: 1. Establish rules to effectively manage risks and ensure continuous observable outcomes from large programs. 2. Incorporate specific incentives and nudging strategies that are tailored to the relevant authorities into service delivery. Breakfast every day is more important than a large birthday gift once a year. Examples of services In the following, we show examples of services where trust and voluntary compliance have been key considerations. The Estonian Tax and Customs Board has redefined its role by focusing on creating user-friendly services for citizens who want to comply rather than solely pursuing enforcement. This shift from “catching the bad guys” to empowering the compliant has transformed the taxpayer experience. By automating processes and reducing tax filing to a single click, the Board has significantly cut the effort required for compliance. The strategy also emphasizes education and clarity – ensuring that citizens understand how the tax system operates and why it matters, further contributing to voluntary compliance. Figure 8. Service delivery strategy for a tax administration. The combined strategy to increase trust and effectiveness (increased tax collection) manifests in specific incentives and strategies relevant to the authority’s problem areas. Tax authority as the protector of equal competition and free market. Solutions and service design to nudge and educate taxpayers to incentivize correct tax behaviour. Low-audit tax authority. Real-time economy brings data analysis to a level where audit becomes very targeted and smart. Paying taxes does not cost taxpayers time or money. For most people, paying taxes takes less than a minute, or no time at all. Companies directly integrate with tax authority to automate tax returns. Tax administration is invisible to the taxpayer. 23 Example 1 Taxes are pre-calculated, and payment is made very easy for the citizen if the citizen consents to sharing data. Pre-filling tax returns has been a successful strategy in decreasing cost of compliance and increasing service reliability. The purpose of this service design is to increase voluntary compliance by increasing service reliability for the citizen through incentives that eventually nudge the citizen toward higher levels of trust. 01 02 Example 2 Showcasing citizen contribution to the state and society; and the state’s contribution to the citizen. Taxpayers will understand how their taxes are utilized (“what I pay for”) and how the state finances are redistributed to benefit the citizen. This service design aims to educate the citizen and increase voluntary compliance through targeted transparency. 25 Example 3 03 The tax administration uses the data collected from the taxpayer to reflect to the taxpayers what their risk is and how they compare to the rest of the industry. This service utilizes the concept of targeted transparency to increase voluntary compliance. With high score, audits would generally not be needed, optimizing the resources of both the tax administration and the taxpayer. Additionally, the service provides the taxpayers with additional value from insights related to their industry in return for compliance, further nudging the taxpayer toward higher voluntary compliance.

    "content": "Case study March 27, 2025 Modernizing member experience through cloud-native infrastructure Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Digital Transformation Enterprise Healthcare In a bold move to transform the member experience, a national health insurer launched a startup-style initiative aimed at delivering a simpler, more personalized healthcare journey. Built from the ground up, the new venture required modern infrastructure, cloud-native applications, and the agility to evolve quickly—all while navigating complex healthcare regulations and legacy tech debt. Challenge After two years of in-depth member research, the organization realized its existing infrastructure couldn’t support the kind of dynamic, consumer-friendly experiences its members demanded. Launching a new company within the enterprise offered the freedom to move fast—but it also required a complete departure from outdated systems. Core challenges included: Legacy technology debt: Internal platforms were rigid, slow to evolve, and burdensome to maintain. Slow delivery cycles: Manual processes and fragmented toolsets limited developer productivity and innovation speed. High operational complexity: Supporting services were scattered across different systems, each with unique tooling and configurations. Lack of observability: Monitoring was inconsistent, making it difficult to detect issues or measure impact in a complex, microservice-heavy environment. Member experience gaps: The organization needed to centralize member tools and data to reduce confusion and improve outcomes. This new venture needed to move fast—combining a startup mindset with enterprise-grade reliability. Solution We joined forces with the client and their cloud technology partner to co-build the infrastructure and application environment that would power this new healthcare experience. Our contributions included: Automation & tooling: We developed internal frameworks and automation libraries tailored to a poly-repo, microservices environment—eliminating repetitive tasks and reducing deployment friction. Modern architecture: The application was built using microservices and event-driven design patterns to allow independent scaling and agile development. CI/CD optimization: Continuous integration and delivery pipelines were implemented to streamline deployments, enforce quality, and increase delivery velocity. Telemetry & observability: We instrumented the infrastructure and applications with end-to-end telemetry, providing deep insight into performance and operational health. Developer enablement: Tooling and documentation empowered teams to build and release features faster, with fewer dependencies. This foundation allowed the client to focus on improving member services while scaling efficiently and securely. Results In just months, the new platform was up and running—offering a cohesive, digital-first experience for Medicaid members and their providers. Infrastructure efficiency: 10% reduction in maintenance costs through platform consolidation Delivery velocity: 3x faster integration of new features Member engagement: 25% increase in digital engagement Improved servicing: Enhanced support experience for both patients and providers Scalable platform: Ready to support new markets and evolving member needs Related content Case study 2.12.2025 Healthcare Technology and Engineering Healthcare Application automatically allocates consultation rooms at TYKS Compass Hospital and in the Salo unit – reducing the need for space by up to 30–40% At the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland’s TYKS Compass Hospital and in the psychiatric unit in Salo, healthcare professionals do not have their own designated examination rooms.

    "content": "Home Insights Enabling mobile commerce innovation Case study March 27, 2025 Enabling mobile commerce innovation Service Strategy and Transformation Industry Digital Transformation Enterprise Telecommunication and Media As one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S., this organization serves millions of customers who expect seamless digital experiences — especially on mobile. But as user expectations evolved, the company’s existing mobile commerce experience was falling behind. They engaged us to redesign the mobile journey from the ground up and create an infrastructure that could support hyper-personalized, high-performance shopping experiences. Challenge The client faced a critical inflection point: while mobile traffic made up over 70% of digital visits, conversion rates on mobile were lagging far behind. A deeper audit revealed the following key challenges: Underperforming mobile UI: The mobile experience was clunky and inconsistent, leading to drop-offs during high-value conversion moments such as plan upgrades, device purchases, or add-on selections. Backend rigidity: The existing backend systems, built years ago for desktop-first use cases, were difficult to integrate with newer mobile interfaces or third-party services. No experimentation culture: Without built-in support for A/B testing or data instrumentation, product teams had limited insight into what changes actually improved the customer experience. Disconnected journeys: Customers often began their journey on mobile but were forced to switch to desktop or call support due to limited functionality or frustrating checkout flows. Limited personalization: Promotions and offers were static, missing opportunities to surface the right bundle or product at the right time based on user behavior. Solution We delivered a comprehensive mobile-first commerce strategy that emphasized speed, personalization, and continuous experimentation. Our solution spanned both frontend transformation and backend enablement: Progressive Web Application (PWA): We built a PWA that felt like a native app—fast, responsive, and capable of offline functionality. This approach reduced friction while allowing users to browse and purchase across devices without downloads. Headless CMS and commerce layers: Decoupling the content and commerce engines allowed for greater flexibility in creating targeted mobile experiences and pushing real-time updates without waiting for backend releases. API-first architecture: We created robust APIs to support personalization, order history, pricing logic, and promotions—allowing new mobile features to be deployed without touching the core systems. Personalization engine: We integrated behavioral data with campaign logic to deliver dynamic offers (e.g., family plans, trade-in deals, early upgrades) based on user profiles and actions. Experimentation platform: We introduced tools and processes for running weekly A/B and multivariate tests across different parts of the mobile journey—from homepage to checkout. Results The mobile transformation not only improved the experience—it unlocked mobile as a high-performing sales channel. What was once a lagging channel became a growth engine — empowering teams to deliver seamless, relevant, and high-converting mobile experiences that exceeded customer expectations. 30% increase in mobile transaction volume within six-months 50% reduction in mobile bounce rates through better speed and design 20% lift in digital CSAT scores Related content Case study 11.09.2025 Healthcare Digital Transformation Healthcare Transforming pathology services at Tartu University Hospital Tartu University Hospital and Nortal successfully launched Estonia’s first integrated pathology information system.

    "content": "AI is useless if your data’s not in order You possess mountains of data. But it’s organised in disjointed- or monolithic infrastructures that cause poor user experiences. Your data aren’t ready to make AI solutions possible. A proper foundation must be laid before any elegant structure can be built. Inflation, cost cuts, and shrinking budgets in the public sector make digital transformation difficult, yet governments are still under pressure to deliver quick and efficient services to citizens. But unfit data means a missed opportunity to use both present-day and future AI tools. Properly organised data mean smart spending that reduces costs overall, generating safe, secure, data-enabled public services that cut through legacy barriers. AI data readiness matrix Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 1 Minimal structure and integration (e.g. raw text files, PDFs, isolated databases) Legacy on-premises systems (e.g. older servers with limited access) No ethical framework (e.g. no policies or oversight for AI) Minimal AI expertise (e.g. general technical knowledge, no dedicated data scientists) Testing the waters Gaining momentum Running seamlessly Leading the way Limited leadership support (e.g. no AI initiatives in roadmap) Partial structure and integration (e.g. basic databases with inconsistent standards) Basic cloud infrastructure (e.g. cloud used for specific functions only) Initial ethical framework (e.g. draft guidelines, limited compliance) Limited AI expertise (e.g. small AI team, limited partnerships) Partial leadership support (e.g. limited funding for pilot projects) Mostly structured and integrated (e.g. central warehouse with regular quality checks) Hybrid infrastructure (e.g. partial cloud migration) Established compliance policies (e.g. documented policies, some oversight) Moderate AI expertise (e.g. established partnerships, engineering knowledge) Active leadership support (e.g. resources allocated, AI goals in strategic plan) Fully structured and Integrated (e.g. centralised warehouse, real- time access) Full cloud infrastructure (e.g. centralised data warehouse with inter-department sharing) Comprehensive ethical framework (e.g. proactive risk assessments, dedicated AI ethics oversight) Strong AI expertise (e.g. dedicated team with advanced expertise and partnerships) Strong leadership support (e.g. dedicated budget, AI integrated across departmental goals) Data Maturity Infrastructure utilization Ethics, compliance & risk AI Expertise & skillset Strategy & leadership support How far along is your organisation when it comes to data readiness? How close are you to employing AI for a better public services? Measure your progress using the five dimensions of this chart. Self-scoring spider chart: maturity and visualisation of dimensions Assess your AI readiness across five dimensions: data structure and quality; infrastructure utilization; ethics, compliance, and risk; AI expertise and skillset; strategy and leadership support. Data Maturity Is your department’s data structured, organised, and of high quality? Is data managed and integrated across all storage systems, such as data warehouses, databases, and potential data silos? Level 3 Level 4 Levels 1-4 represent company AI-readiness levels, with 1 being the lowest and 4 the highest. Axes describe dimensions or categories for assessment and assignment of readiness levels. Level 1 Level 2 Infrastructure utilization What types infrastructure does your department use to store, manage, and access data, and how well does it support your data-driven initiatives? Ethics, compliance & risk Do you have an ethical framework for AI that’s compliant with UK regulations, plus policies to manage AI-associated risks? Strategy & leadership support Does your leadership understand and actively support AI’s potential in the public sector, with AI initiatives integrated into long-term goals? AI Expertise & skillset Do you have in-house expertise in AI, data science, and data engineering? Or partnerships with external organizations to cover skill gaps? Data questions Data Structure and Quality Is your department’s data highly structured and organised—or are things a mess? Data are all over the place with few efforts to ensure quality. (e.g. raw text files, PDFs without a common format, inconsistent entries across databases) There’s some structure and organisation, but quality checks and controls are inconsistent. (e.g. basic spreadsheets and databases with partial standardization, inconsistent naming conventions) Data are structured and organised, you do regular quality checks, though nothing comprehensive. (e.g. standardised tables in relational databases, common data fields, but occasional data entry issues) Data fully structured, organised, of high quality, with rigorous quality assurance protocols. (e.g. well defined relational databases with consistent schema, metadata annotations, automated quality control processes) Data Storage and Integration How do you handle data across a variety of different storage systems, like data warehouses, databases, and potential data silos? Data stored in isolated, unconnected databases and silos with minimal integration, making it difficult to consolidate information. (e.g. multiple legacy databases without a unified access point or data-sharing protocol) Some data integrated, but things are still siloed, limiting the ability to get and use data across departments. (e.g. data sharing occurs on a limited basis, with reliance on manual processes to consolidate information) Data mostly integrated, you have a central data warehouse, though some datasets are still in separate databases. (e.g. data warehouse is in use, but a few departments still rely on individual systems for storage) Data is fully integrated, with all relevant data consolidated into a central data warehouse, allowing seamless access and analysis across departments. (e.g. a centralised data warehouse supports structured, real-time access to standardised data across all units) A B C D A B C D + / 2 = Question 1 Question 2 Your score The questions are multiple-choice, with option ‘a’ corresponding to level 1 and option ‘d’ to level 4 of the AI readiness matrix. No cloud at all: data are kept on-premise and legacy systems bog you down. (e.g. older servers with limited remote access capabilities) You’ve got basic cloud infrastructure, though it’s limited to select applications and not widely used across the department. (e.g. cloud solutions used for specific functions, but most data remains on-premises) You have a mix of on-premise and cloud resources that support data storage and access needs but probably needs additional integration. (e.g. partial migration to cloud with on-premises data warehouses supporting some data) Full cloud infrastructure with robust data management and access systems in place, enabling streamlined, flexible data access and management. (e.g. centralised cloud data warehouse with access controls and data sharing across departments) A B C D Your score Infrastructure types and utilization What kind of infrastructure do you use to store, manage, and access data? Does it support your bigger plans? Infrastructure question The questions are multiple-choice, with option ‘a’ corresponding to level 1 and option ‘d’ to level 4 of the AI readiness matrix. Ethics, compliance, risk management question The questions are multiple-choice, with option ‘a’ corresponding to level 1 and option ‘d’ to level 4 of the AI readiness matrix. Ethics, compliance, and risk management Do you have an ethical AI framework that’s compliant with UK regulations, plus policies to manage AI risks? Nothing at all in place. (e.g. no formal guidance or documentation for responsible AI usage, no oversight for AI projects, and no processes for evaluating ethical risks) There are the beginnings of an ethical framework and compliance policies. (e.g. initial draft of ethical guidelines for AI usage, some awareness of data privacy regulations, but policies are informal and not enforced) Ethical framework and compliance policies are present, but some risk areas still need improvement. (e.g. documented policies on responsible AI use, basic compliance with data privacy standards, and some oversight processes, though not consistently applied across all AI projects) Comprehensive ethical framework and compliance policies in place, with regular updates and a proactive approach to risk management. (e.g. robust ethical guidelines aligned with UK regulations, regular audits for compliance, proactive risk assessments, and dedicated personnel overseeing AI ethics and compliance) A B C D Your score AI expertise and skillset question The questions are multiple-choice, with option ‘a’ corresponding to level 1 and option ‘d’ to level 4 of the AI readiness matrix. AI expertise and skillset Do you have in-house expertise in AI, data science, and data engineering? What about partnerships with external organisations to cover skill gaps? Very little AI expertise in house, and no partnerships to cover skill gaps. (e.g. only a few staff with general technical knowledge, no dedicated data scientists or engineer, and no collaborations with AI experts) Some in-house expertise and some partnerships, but not enough to cover skill gaps. (e.g. small AI team focused on basic analytics, with occasional consulting support for specific AI projects) Moderate in-house expertise with several established partnerships that strengthen capabilities. (e.g. data science team with practical engineering AI knowledge, partnerships with consulting companies or universities for specialised AI projects) Robust in-house AI team with strong expertise, supported by a network of partnerships that provide access to leading AI practices. (e.g. a dedicated AI and data science and engineering team with advanced expertise, collaborating regularly with research institutions or tech companies to stay current on AI advancements) A B C D Your score Strategy and leadership support question The questions are multiple-choice, with option ‘a’ corresponding to level 1 and option ‘d’ to level 4 of the AI readiness matrix. Strategy and leadership support Do your bosses understand and support AI’s potential in the public sector? Are AI initiatives part of long-term goals? Little or no interest in AI from your bosses, with no AI initiatives in the planning stage. (e.g. leadership rarely discusses AI, no budget allocation for AI projects, and no AI-related goals or KPIs in strategic documents) Some interest from leadership in AI’s potential, but AI initiatives are sporadic and not part of a bigger plan. (e.g. occasional mention of AI in meetings, limited funding for small AI pilot projects, but no consistent long-term AI strategy or investment) Leadership actively supports AI, with initiatives included in strategic plans—though integration may be limited. (e.g. leadership has allocated resources for AI development, included AI goals in the strategic plan, but may lack a detailed implementation roadmap for wider AI adoption) Strong leadership support for AI, with clear integration of AI initiatives into your long-term goals and priorities. (e.g., AI is prioritised at the executive level, with dedicated budget and resources, AI goals embedded across departmental objectives, and a roadmap for scaling AI initiatives) A B C D Your score Calculating final AI readiness score Compute the Data Maturity Score: 1. Score each data-related question on a scale from 1 to 4. 2. Average these two scores and round to the nearest whole number to get a single Data Maturity score. Calculate the Overall AI Readiness Score: 1. Use the Data Maturity score along with the scores from the other four dimensions (Infrastructure, Ethics & Compliance, AI Expertise, and Leadership Support). 2. Add these five scores together and divide by 5 to get the overall readiness level 01 Nationwide, near-real time data means policies can be better developed and improved. Demand for services can be accurately forecast without adding significant cost. Smarter planning, better decisions Benefits: How the UK public sector can exploit AI Data readiness for AI means better citizen services and reduced costs overall. These are the four key benefits of exploiting AI: Improve service effectiveness Process casework, fulfil legal obligations like responding to FOIs, recording and sharing data, and managing procurement processes. 02 03 Use generative AI to personalise answers to citizens’ questions, link citizen information across departments; provide information, distribute and accept citizen payments, and provide non-financial transactional services; plus ensure fair and equitable access to services. Boost customer satisfaction and engagement: Reduced risk, positive outcomes: The right data infrastructure and governance ensures solutions are effective, non-biased, ethical, safe, compliant, and secure. 04 Matrix transition considerations: If you know your level, here’s how to move up the ladder AI readiness means adopting emerging technology and reorganising of government work methods relating to service provision and inter- departmental cooperation. With limited budgets and data inconsistencies, AI at Level 1 is often under-leveraged, leading to only marginal improvements in operations. Moving to Level 2 allows the government to strategically target high-impact, data-driven opportunities, making the most of limited resources and minimizing bureaucratic inefficiencies. AI can help streamline and automate routine data processing and administrative tasks, freeing up resources and reducing redundancy Conduct a strategic audit to identify processes where AI can bring immediate relief to both citizens and public workers (e.g., automating responses to routine citizen inquiries, improving data entry workflows). This initial shift to targeted AI implementation creates a foundation for reducing repetitive tasks, accelerating service response times, and increasing operational efficiency. As AI efforts expand at Level 2, fragmented or siloed implementations can limit the broader impact. Moving to Level 3 enables unified AI strategies across departments, reducing redundant processes and standardizing citizen data access. This integration helps improve cross- department collaboration, creating a more streamlined experience for citizens while maximizing the effectiveness of limited budgets. AI’s increased role in personalizing services, such as customizing communications or support based on citizen profiles, can directly improve satisfaction and engagement. Shift focus from isolated AI projects to cross-functional initiatives that allow for a unified approach to citizen data. Standardize AI workflows and establish a central governance framework to ensure consistent use of AI insights across departments. This enables personalized, streamlined service experiences, minimizes redundancy, and ensures AI is part of strategic, budget-conscious decision-making. At Level 3, AI may still be mainly supporting existing processes without fundamentally enhancing agility. Moving to Level 4 allows AI to fully drive improvements, not just in service delivery but in adapting to evolving citizen needs and policy requirements. Embedding AI in core operations allows for continuous process optimization and risk reduction, making government operations more resilient and responsive to citizens while managing resources effectively. Implement real-time feedback loops to enable dynamic service adjustments based on citizen needs and policy changes. Establish an AI ecosystem with automated model deployment, monitoring, and updates to maintain high performance and responsiveness. This shift empowers AI to not only support but optimize critical government functions with human still staying in the loop, however, improving service personalization, managing risks proactively, and increasing overall agility.

    "content": "Home Insights How to get started with GenAI: Get ahead or get left behind Article April 24, 2024 by Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI How to get started with GenAI: Get ahead or get left behind The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) offers an unprecedented opportunity for organizations to gain a competitive advantage. After a year of exploration and testing, it’s time to take action with a clear roadmap that can help mitigate some of the risks. Schedule a demo to see our GenAI solutions in action Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t a new innovation – its development has been a long road punctuated with memorable milestones, including the defeat of Grand Master Gary Kasparov by IBM’s Deep Blue program in 1997. But the emergence of GenAI has turned the business world on its head within the space of just a few months. Its potential to improve processes, efficiency and productivity means that despite the risks, no business can afford to ignore it. This is the real technological revolution and businesses are faced with the stark choice of embracing it or being left behind. The colossal step forward came in November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a free and accessible Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot. The combination of LLMs, which are a massive advancement for AI by combining the ability to gather information with the ability to do something useful with it (such as answer questions), and the global buzz created by ChatGPT has had an unprecedented impact that is transforming the societal and economic landscape. GenAI in practice Since the launch of ChatGPT, organizations worldwide have frantically worked to explore the potential use cases of GenAI across the public and private sectors. The long list includes: Intelligent search – revolutionizing how we navigate vast repositories of information, these solutions help uncover insights, find answers, and discover patterns across diverse datasets, all with a simple query. AI-powered customer service assistants – Natural Language Processing is used to make conversation sound as natural as possible, standard queries are resolved quickly and efficiently and waiting and handling times are reduced. Bank of American’s ‘virtual financial assistant’ Erica, for example, helps users access their balance information, transfer money between accounts, and schedule face-to-face meetings. Starbucks’ customer service chatbot, another good example, guides users through the process of creating and paying for a customized order, notifying them when it is ready for pick-up. Virtual assistants – solutions that carry out administrative support tasks and prioritize incoming messages and calls can be used across multiple sectors. GenAI solutions that generate summaries of reports, customer calls and meetings (as well as listing actions that result from meetings) free up employees to focus their efforts on more productive tasks. Fraud detection in financial services and insurance – LLM models are able to detect unusual patterns, transactions and behaviors. Predictive maintenance solutions that automatically schedule essential work before problems arise. Supply chain optimization – AI solutions can allocate resources, schedule processes, assign people efficiently, predict future demand and identify pinch points along the supply chain. Marketing solutions – including recommendation engines and personalized marketing. Explore more use cases here . But if 2023 was the year of Proofs of Concept, 2024 must be the year of action. For many organizations, the evolutionary pace of AI built around LLMs is both exciting and terrifying. AI has become a necessity to gain a competitive edge, by helping organizations work better and more efficiently. Sitting back and waiting to see how this new world develops is not an option. Being left behind now can give your competitors the upper hand, putting your whole organization at risk. It’s better to start the race, even though no one yet knows what the course looks like or where the finish line will be. Related insights Article LLMs: use cases in financial services Addressing the risks The challenge is that LLMs and the infrastructure that supports them (such as ever more powerful microchips ) are developing so rapidly that the standard approach to project delivery cannot apply. It is deeply unrealistic to invest in multi-year projects; delivery needs to be fast, and intelligently targeted. Investing in innovative and rapidly evolving technology is inherently risky and in our conversations with clients, we consistently hear three big concerns: Accuracy LLMs are not true artificial intelligence – they are essentially a neural network that predicts the next word in a sentence. These models are not infallible, they can get things wrong. Bias Google ’s recent difficulties with its Gemini offering were a high-profile reminder of the complex ethical questions that LLMS raise. In particular, Generative AI models can amplify existing biases within the data they are trained on, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes. Data privacy LLM models have a voracious appetite for data. The risk is that if private information is not protected, the model could inadvertently disclose confidential data as part of its answers. These are very real issues and organizations are right to be concerned, but the risks should not be a barrier to exploring and adopting LLMs – they are a reminder that while exploration of potential uses of LLMs and AI should be a priority, it must be carefully done. Accuracy and data quality, for example, go hand in hand. If the GenAI is not given the right information, it will produce inaccurate results. High-quality data, robust data architecture and well-designed interfaces for interacting with the data are all essential. Related insights Article Navigating the ethical landscape of generative AI Implementing LLMs – a roadmap Organizations are feeling pressure to jump on the LLM bandwagon – this is very promising technology that (mostly) works. It’s very likely that in the next few years, many more organizations will be implementing LLMs into their everyday work. Waiting to see where LLMs take us is arguably more of a risk than exploring the options today. These models can undoubtedly bring competitive advantages but need to be approached with care. At Nortal we work closely with clients to explore the potential AI use cases within their organization through a multi-step process: 1. Understand the challenge AI is a broad field so it is essential that everyone involved has a clear and realistic understanding of how AI technologies work, the current state of play in terms of what the technologies can do, and the readiness of the organization to deploy AI. 2. Identify opportunities Where could AI solutions bring real benefits to the organization? We recommend involving cross-functional people in different departments in discussions so a wide range of different perspectives can be collected. Everyone should feel able to voice their opinions and ideas freely. 3. Validate feasibility Ensure access to data or the possibility to generate realistic sample data is granted (including realistic data quality). 4. Conduct a pilot Matching identified real-use cases with suitable types of AI allows for the creation of prototypes that can be tested for their potential within the context of the organization. It’s essential that the testing stage involves real end-users so their demands can be thoroughly understood. 5. Plan change management A change management plan outlines the strategies, processes, and communication approaches for managing organizational change effectively. 6. Set up a feedback system Feedback from users and other stakeholders allows the solutions to be rapidly iterated and improved. While the right solutions will be unique to each organization, there are three overarching points to remember when implementing GenAI: With data, start where you feel comfortable It can help to visualize the data made available to a LLM in terms of comfort levels. For first use of Gen AI solutions, it makes sense to start with the layer of data that you feel most comfortable with, which usually means your own internal, non-sensitive and non-controversial data. Once you feel more comfortable you can move onto models that use the next level, public data. The final stage is models that use internal, restricted and confidential data. Remember that AI is not a magic bullet It’s essential that you focus on the problem that needs to be solved, rather than on the approach that will be used to solve it. AI or GenAI may not be the most appropriate solution for addressing the problem at hand. Focus on value The best uses cases for GenAI will be unique for each organization, so it’s important to explore use cases within your own context and focus on where AI can add real value. AI implementation for the German Government’s Procurement Office Nortal created an AI-based proof of concept to tackle operational challenges in the procurement process by offering solutions to specific pain points. Read the case study A leap into the unknown We are only scratching the surface of the capabilities of LLMs. DALL-E, developed by OpenAI, is already bridging the gap between visual and written data, and we expect the emergence of NSP, next sentence prediction, to move rapidly this year – this is where models are taught to understand the relationship between sentences and as a result, can better understand the overall meaning of text (and as a result should provide even more accurate responses). More and more use cases that are useful in both the private and public sectors are emerging every day. At Nortal we have implemented GenAI in our own internal processes, so we already have first-hand experience of the journey that many of our clients are undertaking – we are mindful of the risks and limitations of LLMs, as well as the considerable benefits. Our own LLM solution for clients, Nortal Tark , directly address the risks and concerns most frequently raised by organizations – it is installed within the client’s own controlled environment, for example, so they have full control of their data and privacy. We are also working closely with clients across the public and private sectors in different industries to transform their organizations with AI. Our work for the German Government’s Procurement Office , for example, has taken significant steps in addressing sustainability and efficiency issues in public sector procurement by making relevant documents easily accessible and searchable. This is an excellent example of how AI can enhance strategic decision-making and promote transparency. The evolution of GenAI promises to be a rollercoaster for organizations around the world – an exciting leap into the unknown. But organizations who are prepared to take a leap of faith have much to gain. To learn more about Nortal Tark and the possibilities of GenAI, book a demo below.

    "title": "Intelligent Search makes life easier",
    "content": "Article August 15, 2023 by Ken Tilk, Head of Data & AI | Hannes Rõõs, AI Architect | Ulan Yisaev, AI Architect Smart and state of the art – Intelligent Search makes life easier With Intelligent Search you can ask questions just as you would in a conversation and get answers just as effortlessly. Dive deep into your own data, use the language that suits you best, and enjoy the peace of mind that secure operations powered by large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge technologies bring. Service Data and AI Navigating today’s maze of information can feel daunting. Jumping between documents, hassling your workmates, or knocking on unfamiliar doors. Intelligent Search does away with all the hassle by bringing everything together in one solution where things like the operating environment, text and audio/video format, and context language don’t matter. What can Intelligent Search do? Imagine a single digital hub that effortlessly blends Sharepoint files, Confluence pages, Teams meeting recordings, emails, and even your talent planning tools. Now imagine asking that same hub a simple question like “Show me projects completed in Finland’s industrial sector?” or “Which Java Developers are available from September to December?” But it’s not just about asking; it’s about understanding too. Your team can ask questions and get answers in their own language, even if the source content is in a different language. And if you’re someone who likes to sweat the details, Intelligent Search can highlight the exact snippet the answer is taken from. Feel like a conversation? Switch to chat mode, dig deeper, ask questions, and uncover more. If you only need insights from a select few documents, try the “Document Chatting” feature and rest easy knowing that these standalone files won’t mingle with your core dataset. The best part? We sculpt Intelligent Search to sit perfectly wherever you need it – whether on a webpage, in Microsoft Teams, or on your preferred platform. How does it work? Intelligent Search leverages state-of-the-art technologies. At its core is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for question answering (QA). This approach combines the best of retrieval-based and generative methods for QA, ensuring precise and contextually relevant answers. RAG methods enable us to give the large language model access to an up-to-date knowledge base. This approach is generally considered more efficient in terms of computational resources and time compared to training a model from scratch or fine-tuning. However, depending on the specific needs of a particular project and customer, we also have the capability to train a model from scratch or fine-tune it. Our demo environment is built on the Haystack open-source LLM orchestration framework, but this is just one of the many options available in our highly customizable solution. Thanks to Haystack’s flexibility we can integrate the latest natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly the Transformer-based models, which have revolutionized the field of semantic document search, question answering, and summarization. This framework is particularly adept at implementing Large-scale Fact-checking QA (LFQA) systems, which use a large corpus of documents as a knowledge base. This two-step process involves retrieval, where relevant documents or passages are identified, and generation, where a response is crafted based on the retrieved documents. Our solution’s flexibility means it can be tailored to run on other latest open-source models and be deployed either on-premise or on any cloud provider, including local ones. Instead of directly using OpenAI’s models, our system integrates with the Azure OpenAI Service LLM models so we have access to the most advanced language models while also benefiting from Azure’s robust security and enterprise-grade features. The journey of data: From acquisition to indexed embeddings The graph below shows how raw data is transformed into a structured and searchable format, highlighting the steps involved in preparing the data for efficient retrieval. Decoding user queries: From simple questions to intelligent responses The graph below shows the process of understanding and responding to user queries, emphasizing the sophistication and intelligence behind generating relevant answers. Robust security you can count on Security is the number-one priority in the digital age, so Intelligent Search packs several robust measures. It can be tailored to use fine-grained access control so that only users with permission to view the underlying documents can see search results. This is crucial if your organization handles sensitive data or needs information to be strictly compartmentalized. All data is encrypted , both at rest and in transit, using advanced encryption standards. This not only protects against external threats but ensures that readable data isn’t exposed if there’s a breach. Because our demo environment uses the Azure OpenAI Service , it benefits from Microsoft Azure’s robust infrastructure. This includes data encryption both at rest and in transit using FIPS 140-2 compliant 256-bit AES encryption. Azure also includes abuse monitoring to detect and mitigate potential misuse. If Azure isn’t your preferred choice, our solution can be adapted to prioritize security considerations inherent to open-source models and on-premise hardware. This flexibility ensures that, regardless of your chosen implementation, data integrity and security remain uncompromised. Flexible, versatile, and model-agnostic Intelligent Search not only leverages OpenAI’s LLMs, but can also be set up to run on open-source models, either on premise or on any cloud provider that can provide the needed hardware. In recent months, several high-performing LLMs, such as Falcon and Llama 2, have been made available by their developers. This opens up countless opportunities for organizations that can’t or don’t want to use Open Ai’s closed-source, commercial models that require sending data to their servers. Even though most evaluation benchmarks still rank GPT-4 higher than the best open-source alternatives, the gap is closing, and in many use cases it is insignificant. Besides generative LLMs, there are also models for many other related use cases, such as semantic search. The performance of the best open-source text similarity models is comparable to the offering of OpenAI, the inference speed is high, and the hardware requirements are relatively low. The semantic search model can be combined seamlessly with a generative LLM to cover the entire Intelligent Search pipeline – enabling thorough answers to queries and questions based on your own documents by finding the most relevant documents and then generating the answer based on them. It is also possible to use LLMs to develop chatbots that consider previous discussions when answering users’ questions. Even though it is also possible to use general-usage LLMs for tasks as diverse as translation, summarization, and question answering on structured data, there are also specific open-source models for other tasks related to such use cases. In addition to those, there are also models to convert speech to text and vice versa if needed. This diversity of capabilities allows our product to cater to a wide range of tasks, ensuring versatility and utility across various applications. What do I need to host Intelligent Search? The hardware you need will depend on whether you’re hosting the model yourself or prefer to use an API to a third party. If you’re hosting, then you need to decide whether this will be done on a cloud or on-premise platform. We have hands-on experience deploying our system on both Azure and AWS cloud platforms as well as on premise. Each platform offers unique advantages, from scalability and performance to specific security features and regional data storage options. If you’re not using LLM as a service from a third-party provider like OpenAI, you’ll need to bear in mind that LLMs are generally trained on very large corpuses and have billions of trainable parameters, which means running them takes a lot of computing power. To run most of them, access to GPU or TPU power is needed, as running on CPUs will be prohibitively slow in most cases. Because of the considerable hardware requirements associated with LLMs, efforts have been made to mitigate their demands without compromising their performance. One approach involves using quantized versions of these models. In this context, quantization refers to the reduction of numerical precision, wherein floating-point values are approximated using a smaller set of bits. While this technique can lead to a reduction in the computational load and memory requirements of LLMs, it comes with inherent trade-offs linked to precision. The process of quantization may lead to a loss of subtle details in the model’s output, potentially affecting the quality and accuracy of generated text. Consequently, the decision to deploy quantized LLMs should be carefully weighed against the specific use case’s requirements for precision and performance. Moving from 16-bit precision to 8-bit precision doesn’t result in a noticeable drop in output quality, while moving to 4-bit version has a more substantial impact. Even though some smaller LLMs can be evaluated for personal use on more powerful laptops, for industrial use the deployment of LLMs predominantly follows two primary pathways: on-premise deployment or cloud-based solutions. On-premise implementation involves configuring and hosting the models within your organization’s own infrastructure. This approach gives you greater control over data security, privacy, and compliance while also allowing for customization in line with your business requirements. Alternatively, cloud solutions involve leveraging the computational resources and infrastructure of third-party cloud providers. Cloud-based deployment offers scalability and flexibility, enabling you to swiftly adapt to varying workloads without having to invest heavily in hardware. It also relieves the burden of hardware management and maintenance, allowing your teams to focus on their core tasks. The choice between on-premise and cloud deployment hinges on factors like your security needs, operational preferences, and the available technological infrastructure.

    "title": "Will tangled processes derail the vision of Personal Government?",
    "content": "Home Insights Will tangled processes derail the vision of Personal Government? Article September 2, 2024 Will tangled processes derail the vision of Personal Government? What if public administration was no longer public, but personal? What if public services — from the state to municipalities, from health authorities to emergency services —operated on our terms as citizens, completely redefining our relationship with the public sector? Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government In late spring ’24, Nortal Finland had the honor of speaking at the State Expo in Helsinki, on the theme “Personal Government”. The presentation was about citizen-centric public administration services and our vision of an advanced citizen portal, (where, by the way, the Estonian government is pulling ahead compared to Finland!). To our delight, the speech sparked so much thought in the audience that afterward there was a queue of participants wanting to discuss and ask questions at our event booth. The vision of personalized public administration is both intriguing and well-received, but there are still obstacles to overcome — one of them being a tangled mess of systems. Personalized public administration will become a reality in the post-digital era – or will it ? Traditional public services have been digitized throughout the 2000s. From the 2010s onwards, face-to-face and paper-based services have also been completely replaced by their digital counterparts. Gradually, the most advanced municipalities, cities, and agencies have even started to look at their services across society, rather than individual developments. Now, in the 2020s, we are already moving into the post-digital era, where citizens should be able to enjoy a “personal government”. The focus shifts to the citizen’s current life circumstances, instead of service pathways shaped by individual public entities. This requires turning the traditional view of government, it’s plethora of regulations, rules, authorities, and services inside-out to focus on what the citizen should experience – their data, their contextual opportunities, and obligations, and reducing or hiding away everything else. This development is often seen as a manifestation of the citizen portal, which on a mobile device – or other devices – contains all your information, opportunities, and responsibilities. Public services are always in your pocket. The portal simplifies interactions with public administration, with everything you need just a few clicks away. Fewer hands stirring the pot However, the vision of human-centric, accessible, proactive, and reliable citizen services cannot be realized if the underlying systems and service processes are tangled like spaghetti: solutions and systems don’t communicate, information doesn’t flow, and service paths aren’t connected. On top of the challenges posed by a confusing technological environment, research institutions such as Keva also predict that up to one in three people working for the Finnish state/municipalities will retire by 2030. This means that within five years, there will be more citizens in need of services, but fewer people available to run them, even with the support of back-office systems. It’s unrealistic to assume we could recruit the same number, or more, of employees for municipalities, cities, and government agencies. Additionally, the traditional viewpoint or belief that only another human is able to render services in a way that also feels human, shall be challenged. This means we need to make things more efficient. From Alt-Tab fatigue to truly productive work Low-code/no-code solutions have made giant strides in recent years, enabling the rapid development and flexible customization of public administration applications, automation, and software robots without in-depth programming skills. Each of us can probably recognize the situation where we are trying to get a slightly more complex task done, but the workflow requires constant jumping from one application to another. Switching between screens using the Alt-Tab is fairly painless, but copying data from one screen to another is hardly what most of us dreamed of doing. Low-code solutions play a key role in improving the efficiency and modernization of the systems and processes underlying public services. Instead of €10 million system modernization projects, low-code tools can be used to agilely build a composite layer on top of the underlying systems. This layer orchestrates workflows so that there is no longer any need to jump between different systems. Instead, opportunities for faster and more flexible citizen service development, fewer human errors, better data flow, and less time wasted on routine tasks are achieved. Low-code tools in action Low-code tools can for example help automate repetitive tasks such as reading and pulling together documents and reports, or processing and filing permit applications. Filling in forms, sending notifications, and copying and updating data can also be handled automatically. All this frees up the time of the constantly shrinking workforce for more complex and value-added tasks. From a systems perspective, low-code solutions can help connect disparate products, solutions, and databases. They enable seamless integration of different services, making information sharing and decision-making in real-time. With low-code solutions, a citizen’s personalized public administration could therefore genuinely rely on seamless data transfer between different authorities, rather than experiencing delays, errors, and costs caused by human intervention at each interface. Steps toward the vision of Personal Government Personal Go vernment in Finland does not have to remain just a vision. Progress is already underway, but sometimes it’s worth shifting our focus from the tools and interfaces visible to citizens to the systems and processes that make these services possible, i.e. the underlying systems and processes. Today’s low-code tools offer the potential for significant advances in data usability, routine automation , and process streamlining – without the need for multi- million-euro systems projects.

    "content": "Home Insights Mythbusters: three tested truths about low-code as a driver of digitalization in public administration Article September 12, 2024 Mythbusters: three tested truths about low-code as a driver of digitalization in public administration The future of the public sector in Finland depends on how effectively we leverage digitalization to overcome bottlenecks in public services. An even more ambitious goal should be to modernize entire processes and employee workflows. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government In our previous article , we explored the role of low-code solutions in managing the complexity of backend systems and processes, which at worst can hinder the development of citizen- and employee-centric services. Here, we present three persistent low-code myths that, in our experience, prevent mid-level management in Finnish public administration agencies, healthcare districts and companies from fully utilizing these versatile tools. We also share real-life examples from our clients who have successfully debunked these myths. #1 Low- c ode isn’t just for the IT Department Low-code solutions are not just tools for the IT department. They enable business experts to actively participate in the design process and even act as independent “citizen developers. Experts without deep technical knowledge can use pre-built software components to create and modify applications and automations on their own, thereby speeding up the development of their daily tools. Meanwhile, IT is responsible for managing citizen developer and development practices and developing broader and more complex low-code solutions. In step-by-step development, where users play an active role alongside IT, new innovations also emerge. As business experts’ understanding grows, they often identify ways to improve the system’s usability and functionality, as well as entirely unexpected opportunities , such as automating manual data entry or other repetitive tasks. A great automation innovation was developed for one of our clients, whose old and rigid product management system was replaced with a low-code solution. The goal was to provide corporate-level access to product data spread across various systems within the organization. We built the data model and designed the user interfaces to be flexible, aligning with the client’s brand identity and the logic of the old system . This allowed end users to leverage their expertise from the previous solution and lowered the adoption threshold. Low-code tools were particularly satisfying by automating data maintenance: a stack of regularly manually updated Excel sheets was replaced with automated data management enabled by the low-code platform, freeing employees from a significant amount of manual data transfer work. #2 Low-code tools aren’t a one-size-fits-all approach We have observed with satisfaction that in some wellbeing areas, for instance, low-code applications and automations built for internal use have become commonplace. The most advanced players in other areas of the Finnish public administration are proactively seeking external assistance to support their officials in low-code development. However, progress is still unnecessarily slow and fragmented. The capabilities of low-code platforms, particularly Microsoft’s Power Platform, go far beyond simple citizen developer applications. These platforms offer an excellent opportunity to modernize bottlenecks in even the most critical processes and simplify the user experience of legacy systems — potentially replacing them altogether. At Nortal, our customers’ low-code projects typically begin by addressing a specific operational challenge. However, forward-thinking organizations soon realize, especially as the first solutions are completed, that the same logic or other features of the platform can be applied much more broadly across processes — either by deepening a specific task or by expanding it across various stages of the employee journey. For instance, starting from a relatively simple hospital room reservation application, we expanded the solution to consider not only the reception rooms but also the equipment, tools, and personnel required for patient visits. This approach shifts the focus in application development from just the facilities to the overall patient encounter, enabling the delivery of even better service. Alternatively, the perspective of room reservations could also be expanded to encompass the entire service journey of the employee — in this case, the healthcare professional: how to digitalize and simplify tasks before the patient’s visit and the related reservation, and how to proceed with subsequent actions such as symptom assessments, treatment plans, and follow-up appointment scheduling. Solutions built on low-code platforms can thus expand to cover extensive, business-critical processes. The key word, however, is incremental progression: starting with the optimization of a single individual, unit, or service encounter, and then expanding the implementations target by target to meet the needs of the entire process or organization. #3 Low-code is just another tool Public sector actors face immense pressure from citizens, political stakeholders, and local and international regulations, so the requirements for systems can change rapidly. Providing quality and efficient services requires solutions and development projects to respond to changes almost in real time, all while cost pressures continue to rise. In traditional software development methods and the “waterfall model,” massive development projects were pushed forward based on frozen plans and definitions made in advance. If the direction was off, months or even years of work could effectively go to waste. Modern low-code platforms like Microsoft Power Platform revolutionize the foundations of digitalization development. With the platform’s visual interfaces and pre-built components, new solutions can be created and implemented within weeks, even days, enabling a new level of development agility. Changes tailored to business needs — such as creating and fine-tuning application business rules — can be done with low-code even in the client’s presence during meetings. Tasks that previously consumed time and resources for negotiation and approval in projects typically included designing forms and interfaces, establishing naming conventions, managing users, and reviewing new features of the platform. Now, doing these tasks collaboratively accelerates the process and fosters shared understanding and ongoing communication between clients and consultants. However, it’s important to note that agile low-code design does not abandon fundamental principles of software development, such as lifecycle and version management or documentation. The second wave of agile development also involves the business side The rapid digitalization development in public administration and our entire society over the past few decades has shifted the reins from true customer-facing experts to IT organizations. Low-code solutions, with their new agility, provide an excellent opportunity to involve business experts in creating essential tools for daily work — even allowing them to build these tools independently. In our view, low-code development will play a key role in creating a more flexible and efficient public administration in Finland. It is now high time for public administration business units to familiarize themselves with the true potential of low-code tools.

    "content": "Home Insights Getting the most out of low-code: how to approach a new way of thinking? Article September 26, 2024 Getting the most out of low-code: how to approach a new way of thinking? Imagine this scenario: your organization has embraced low-code and recognized how it can be used to tame the tangled mess of applications behind citizen portals and services. It also empowers the experts on the frontlines to actively participate in building their own applications. Service Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Solutions emerge like toy houses made of Lego blocks, and their numbers grow exponentially. However, your newly liberated experts, exhilarated by their newfound digital freedom, ride off into the sunset with increasingly exotic applications, disregarding the constraints of GDPR, documentation, and data security. All that remains is a cloud of evaporating money spent on low-code platform licenses. Opportunities and a few storm clouds on the horizon The wild west scenario described is unlikely to be a daily reality for most companies or public sector organizations. However, as we discussed in our latest article, even individual low-code applications have already provided significant benefits to daily digitalization. Many of our clients have also recognized that, if left unchecked, the mass of low-code applications and automations — which otherwise simplify daily tasks — can lead to problems. Here are a few examples: Overlapping development work in different parts of the organization Security and data privacy risks caused by careless access permissions Wasted resources due to inefficient use of licenses Loss of knowledge when developers leave Time wasted due to unreliable , faulty applications These challenges can, however, be tamed by harnessing the full potential of low-code, particularly the Microsoft Power Platform, through two complementary perspectives that sit between business and IT: an organizational and process-focused governance model, and a Center of Excellence (CoE) that provides technical support and backing for developers and business units. Governance model : security , compliance , and budget control A well-designed low-code governance model helps optimize the development and use of applications and automations. It ensures that all solutions produced adhere to the company’s standards and regulations, clarifies operating models and responsibilities, reduces risks, and improves overall security. The low-code governance model also reduces overlapping development efforts by defining clear processes and approval procedures for new tools, preventing resources from being wasted on developing a dozen nearly identical applications. If someone, somewhere, develops something ingenious, it can be easily replicated elsewhere. The governance model promotes collaboration between different business units and ensures that everyone is aware of new solutions and established best practices. The governance model defines clear ownership for components, access rights and roles, eliminating the need to grant all possible permissions to everyone “just in case.” This way, an eager user can no longer accidentally open a public interface that allows anyone to access confidential information, such as customer or patient data. Although low-code platform licenses are often cheaper than ready-made solutions, they are by no means free. With a governance model in place, license costs can be kept under control by allocating the right number of permissions based on actual needs. A well-managed environment strategy includes distinct environments for development, testing, and production. Unverified features no longer appear unexpectedly in the daily lives of end users, as development work is carried out in distinct development and testing environments. Center of Excellence ( CoE ): catalyst for innovation The Center of Excellence (CoE) is the powerhouse of an organization utilizing the Power Platform — a group of designated experts aimed at supporting developers and business units in making the most effective use of low-code. Microsoft has developed the CoE Starter Kit for Power Platform which is a collection of components and tools. By leveraging its templates and best practices, processes for managing and monitoring applications and automations are established, user training for utilizing the Power Platform is supported, efficient use of platform resources and licenses is tracked, and reports on application usage, performance, and compliance are generated. In the wild west, no one monitors whether applications and automations actually work, and instead of saving time, they may become time sinks for the organization. The CoE provides developers and business units with guidelines and tools that ensure applications and automations function correctly and as intended. An often underestimated but essential part of application development is documenting the implemented solutions. Even the most ingenious application loses its edge if no one understands how it works or how to maintain and update it after the developer has left. The CoE can help define practices that ensure that implemented solutions are properly documented. This way, the functionality, maintenance, and development of applications can continue even after the developer has moved on to new challenges. Strategic harnessing of low-code benefits Low-code tools offer a great opportunity to tackle the chaos of legacy systems that has developed over time in the public sector or to automate repetitive routines in any customer-facing work. However, based on our experience, the useful guidelines established for traditional software development may be overlooked in the excitement of low-code. Uncontrolled use of the tools can lead to security risks, overlapping development efforts, or wasted resources. A well-designed governance model and the Microsoft Power Platform Center of Excellence toolkit facilitate the risk-free realization of business value and time savings. It is advisable to start building a low-code governance model well in advance — not only when the wild west is already in full swing. When the practices are clear, citizen developers do not have to worry about what they can or cannot do, allowing innovations to flow freely. The governance model and CoE guide citizen developers in selecting the right tools and methods, support the widespread deployment of the most useful applications, and provide visibility into existing implementations to reduce overlapping work.

    "content": "Home Insights The first law regulating Artificial Intelligence. A guide to the EU AI ACT Article December 19, 2023 The first law regulating Artificial Intelligence. A guide to the EU AI ACT The rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) suitable for everyday use marks a decisive moment in the history of humanity. Many of our familiar processes need to be rethought and redefined. The Bank of America even named AI “the new electricity”. We, as human beings, have managed to develop a technology capable of understanding our language, capturing our ways of communicating, learning through our data, and generating functions that were only previously imaginable in science fiction. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government An industrial revolution is taking place in a context of worldwide interconnectedness through the internet, facilitating the generation of new ideas and improving cooperation mechanisms. This creates an unprecedented environment for innovation with an impetus that is second to none. We live in an exciting era that we, as a company, are actively shaping. For this reason, it is essential to critically question the change processes that have been initiated: What does the world we are building look like? What influence are we allowing AI to have on our processes? How will we shape the relationship between AI and the people of tomorrow? The answers to these and many other questions will shape our lives in the coming decades. Act on Artificial Intelligence Recently, the European Union presented an innovative proposal called the EU AI Act (AIA) to lay the foundations for the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in the EU. These new rules are in line with Nortal’s vision for development and deployment: Artificial Intelligence is developed and implemented responsibly and ethically. Key messages and their impact on AI users and developers A Harmonised Legal Framework The proposal aims to create a harmonised legal framework for developing, marketing, and using AI products and services across the EU. For clients, this means a standardised approach to AI usage regulations. Compliance promotes trust and reliability in the AI solutions used. Safety and Regulations The AIA ensures that AI systems and solutions marketed in the EU are safe and compliant with the EU’s legal framework. This strengthens the security of the AI applications themselves and creates legal certainty for their developers and users. The extent to which these regulations encourage or do not encourage innovation and investment in a secure AI is the subject of current debates. AI Governance and Fundamental Rights Improving governance and effectively implementing EU law on fundamental rights and security requirements for AI systems are critical. Therefore, clients who use AI are obliged to employ ethical and responsible AI practices as described in the AIA. Definition of AI Systems Article 3(1) of the AIA defines a system of artificial intelligence as software developed using (specific) techniques and approaches that can generate output such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions for select human-defined objectives that affect the environment with which it interacts. This definition includes a variety of software-based technologies, including machine learning, logic and knowledge-based systems, and statistical approaches. This provides AI users with clarity about the risk level of the AI solution they prefer and the regulations and legal responsibility associated with its scope of application. The proposal recognises the complexity of artificial intelligence and, therefore, formulates a legal definition of “AI systems” and their influence, divided into four risk levels. Risk-Based Approach Understanding the unique risks associated with AI, the AIA follows a risk-based approach and categorises AI systems by risk level. For clients who use AI, this approach ensures that regulatory interventions correspond to the specific risks that arise from their applications. Unacceptable Risk: Prohibits harmful AI practices that pose clear threats to security and rights, such as subliminal manipulative techniques or the exploitation of vulnerable groups. High Risk: Regulates high-risk AI systems that adversely affect security or fundamental rights, including those used as security components in various products and in certain critical areas such as law enforcement and education. Limited Risk: AI solutions in this risk group are subject to a more flexible and straightforward regulatory approach. This category includes solutions that interact with people, such as a chatbot, automatic generation of document summaries or reporting, or tools for automatic translation in international communication. Low or minimum risk: AI systems with low or minimum risks are also subject to minimum regulatory requirements. Clients in this category must adhere to the smallest number of regulations, promoting innovation and development. Naturally, this new regulatory framework raises many questions. In particular, how to approach the development of new AI solutions for those involved in the development of artificial intelligence and those who want to use it as (partial) solutions for their target groups. Reading the definitions of the European Union carefully, it becomes clear that AI innovations are significantly influenced by the risk levels to which they and/or their use cases are assigned. Among other things, it plays a vital role in how your AI solution will communicate with people, whether it is used only internally, is accessible to everyone on the internet, or what expenses will be generated with it. Ethics, transparency, trust, and risk mitigation are concepts that we have always applied in our work with highly sensitive data and in developing and implementing solutions. This type of development depends not only on the technical capabilities but also on how these projects are thought and planned and on evaluating the impact the solution will have at an early stage.

    "title": "Navigating the ethical landscape of generative AI",
    "content": "Home Insights Navigating the ethical landscape of Generative AI Article February 8, 2024 by Dillon Dayton, Solutions Architect Navigating the ethical landscape of Generative AI In the era of data-driven innovation, we are witnessing the remarkable rise of generative AI, a powerful technology capable of producing new, original content that mimics human creations. While generative AI holds immense promise for advancing various fields, from art and music to medicine and scientific research, it also raises critical ethical concerns that demand careful consideration. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, often sourced from the internet or other digital repositories. This data serves as the foundation upon which these models learn to generate new content. However, the ethical implications of data collection and usage in generative AI are complex and multifaceted. Data Bias and Fairness: Generative AI models can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in the data they are trained on, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For instance, a model trained on biased datasets could generate content that reinforces stereotypes or unfairly disadvantages certain groups of people. Data Privacy and Security: The collection, storage, and use of personal data for generative AI training raise privacy concerns. Individuals have the right to control how their data is used, and organizations must implement robust data privacy practices to protect sensitive information. Data Ownership and Attribution: The question of data ownership and attribution becomes particularly complex when generative AI produces content that is indistinguishable from human-created work. Clearly defining the ownership and usage rights of AI-generated content is crucial for both ethical and legal considerations. Global Perspectives: Generative AI should be considered globally to combat bias. Consider cultural differences, varying legal frameworks, and diverse values. The social impact must be carefully evaluated to ensure responsible AI use and development that benefits all. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including marketing and advertising. However, the use of generative AI in these domains raises concerns about the potential for perpetuating gender stereotypes and biases. For instance, consider a marketing campaign that utilizes AI-generated images to represent the target audience. If the training data for the AI model is predominantly composed of images of women in stereotypical roles, such as housewives or caregivers, the AI may generate images that reinforce these stereotypes. Similarly, AI-powered ad copy generation could perpetuate gender stereotypes if trained on a dataset of advertisements that rely on gender stereotypes to sell products or services. For example, the AI may generate ad copy that associates’ women with beauty and domesticity, while associating men with intelligence and professional success. These examples illustrate how generative AI can perpetuate gender biases, potentially leading to harmful consequences. Stereotypical portrayals of women can reinforce harmful gender norms and limit women’s perceptions of their own potential. Additionally, biased advertising can perpetuate gender inequality in the workplace and society at large. To mitigate these concerns, it is crucial to adopt responsible practices in the development and use of generative AI for marketing and beyond. This includes: Transparency: Generative AI models should be transparent and explainable, allowing users to understand how the models generate content and the factors that influence their decisions. This transparency is essential for building trust and enabling informed decision-making. Human Oversight and Accountability: Generative AI should not be used to replace human judgment or decision-making in critical areas. Humans should maintain oversight and control over AI systems to ensure that ethical considerations are taken into account and that AI does not perpetuate biases or harm human well-being. In the US, there are already several initiatives at the federal and state level to help address these concerns. Consider the Presidential Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence or the AI Bill of Rights , proposed by the White House Office of Science and Technology to implement five principles for responsible AI development, including fairness, non-discrimination, and most importantly human oversight. Accountability and Liability: Clear accountability and liability mechanisms must be established for AI-generated content, particularly when it impacts individuals or society. This includes addressing potential harm caused by AI-generated content, such as misinformation, hate speech, or manipulation. Data Diversity: A crucial aspect of responsible generative AI development is using diverse and representative datasets to train AI models, ensuring that these models are not biased towards certain groups or perspectives. Model Governance: A framework of guiding principles that ensures the model is using and generating data that is of quality, secure, available, private, compliant, and has a steward of ownership to manage the product. By adopting these measures, we can harness the power of generative AI for effective marketing and advertising while minimizing the risk of perpetuating bias and promoting more equitable and inclusive representation. Here at Nortal, we are contributing to ethical AI by helping our customers understand the ethical implications that come with generative AI and how to navigate these scenarios.

    "title": "Data Engineering in the Age of AI",
    "content": "Home Insights Data Engineering in the Age of AI Article April 25, 2024 by Predrag Djojic, Head of Engineering Data Engineering in the Age of AI To assess the role of data engineering at present and its future, we first need to look at the undisputed force behind the latest tech wave, AI, and more specifically, generative AI. Service Data and AI Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Enterprise Industry Victor Hugo once said, “ Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” It was a long time ago, in a very different context. Still, anyone who’s closely watching the AI landscape and development around generative AI in the past few years will probably find some analogy. It took ChatGPT just two months after its public release date to reach 100M active users, making it one of the fastest-growing applications ever. Major cloud vendors and the largest tech companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Apple, focused their R&D efforts on AI and dedicated their biggest tech conferences almost entirely to new AI-infused services and products. New g enerative AI models are revealed daily, each claiming huge advancements in accuracy and operational performance. On the other hand, the battle of arguments around ethics and legal frameworks for the technology is in full swing, including governments, experts, “experts,” and the media. As a first result, the EU agreed on the Artificial Intelligence Act, while the White House has announced the first government-wide policy instructing every federal agency to appoint a chief AI officer. We have had several of these “Hype Cycles\" so far, always followed by proportionally intense and prolonged disappointments and de-investing periods – AI winters. Under an avalanche of available information, it’s difficult to understand how much of that is pure hype and how much is real technology breakthrough. There are arguments on the other side too. This is not the first dawn of AI; g enerative AI is just the latest incarnation of it. Over the past decades, we have had several of these “Hype Cycles”, as famously named by Gartner, so far, always followed by proportionally intense and prolonged disappointments and de-investing periods – AI winters. Some believe this time is not going to be any different. According to the 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle™ for AI , we find ourselves at “the Peak of Inflated Expectations” regarding g enerative AI. This is not totally without basis. According to the recent O’Reilly survey , regarding the use of g enerative AI in the Enterprise, the most common reason for not using (more of) it is the difficulty in finding appropriate business cases. From the R&D side, most of the new models, including the leading one from OpenAI, are still based on refinements of Transformer , 6+ years old technology relying on massive volumes of training data. The bad news is that we already “used” most of the available and meaningful training data on those models – not to mention the environmental impact of running, until now, unseen volumes of GPUs in data centers. Capitalizing on GenAI For organizations aiming to stay relevant in the coming years, this opens up some important questions and topics to (re)consider. First, a fundamental one. Is all generative AI advancement that we are witnessing truly the next industrial revolution, maybe even the final one, or is it just another hype cycle reaching its peak, soon to be followed by another AI winter? I believe that the answer is a bit of both. Undeniably, there is lots of hype, and there will be disappointments ahead, mostly among those expecting generative AI to reach the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) level. Still, if we tone down our expectations, the technology is already solid, operational at-scale, quickly developing, and already providing significant benefits in many places ( survey ). The second question is more practical. What should organizations and businesses do to stay relevant in the coming years, mindful of AI advancements but without the ambition and resources to compete with OpenAI or the hyperscalers? To grab opportunities in a timely manner and identify threats before it’s too late, organizations need to start/continue experimenting with AI in their respective domains, building knowledge, and following developments. In parallel, to truly benefit from those newly acquired insights and knowledge, organizations need to focus on identifying, collecting, and processing their specific business data. On a technical level , most organizations and businesses mentioned above will rely on foundation AI models provided by OpenAI, Anthropic, or some of the cloud hyperscalers – consumed as a service. It’s safe to assume that those already advanced models will improve over time in all critical areas: correctness, comprehension, performance, and cost. However, as those advancements will be available to virtually everyone with a credit card, those can’t be considered a competitive advantage on their own. Those AI services delivered over the SaaS model by large vendors are going to be “well-behaved” and “well-educated” on many topics (trained on a large generic set of data). Still, to make it a real and sustainable competitive advantage, organizations using the services need to make those AI models experts in a specific domain and apply it in a specific operational context. Without relevant and specific data at volume, most of the experimentations with AI will underdeliver on promises or will be limited to relatively generic use cases. The (data) pillars carrying AI This leads us back to our main topic. The role of data and data processing in the age of AI. Collecting and storing data at volume is often not simple or cheap. Even then, volume alone will not cut it, as data quality is equally important, further increasing the need for advancing data processing capabilities. Next to volume and quality, data format and variety requirements are evolving too. The best g enerative AI models are multimodal, relying on multiple data types and sources to provide insights and generate content. For the first time, we can process video, sound, images, and text in combination with relative ease and on top of all “traditional” data formats. The size and usefulness of heterogenic data sets will grow in significance and require even more sophisticated data processing techniques with more extensive storage and computing capacities. Finally, we have privacy and security requirements and some truly new challenges there. As a recent research paper shows, it’s possible to extract training data from most of today’s available g enerative AI models at a rate 150× higher than expected (tested on Pythia, Llama, Falcon, ChatGPT, etc.).The extracts contained a broad set of personally identifiable information (PII) as well as financial data or even security-related information acquired from used source code repositories. On the other hand, the emergence of regulative frameworks such as the recent EU Artificial Intelligence Act increases the need to establish data lineage in all cases where data is used for training, finetuning, or querying on top of g enerative AI models. As we will store and use more of it, and there is no easy way to remove data from an already trained model, we also need to care more about what data we store and how it is used. Organizations and businesses aiming to stay relevant in the future need to master their respective data domains to capture specific operational, business, and domain knowledge through data. The new generation of AI is arriving quickly and will undeniably have a significant and broad impact on the economy. Still, data-related questions – what, where, and how we use it – are still the center of “everything.” From a practical side, organizations and businesses aiming to stay relevant in the future, in addition to AI, need to master their respective data domains to capture specific operational, business, and domain knowledge through data. Once captured, data must be cleaned, deduplicated, potentially anonymized, enriched and augmented, classified, stored, and secured. Even if we safely assume that Data Engineering will significantly advance due to the infusion of AI in the data processing toolchain, there is still a lot to cover, and the effort needed should not be underestimated. If the main goal is to be future-proof, then a large part of a good AI Strategy is an up-to-date Data Strategy, with modern Data Engineering as more than a necessary enabler. Want to know more?

By unifying those sources into real-time dashboards, the team unlocked stronger visibility, faster ticket resolution, and more efficient decision-making. Service Microsoft About the company BIC is an international company whose products can be found across the globe.

Our team at Tero by Nortal worked directly with BIC’s Group IT Services team to go beyond the local and regional data and provide solutions that could centralize KPIs through updated dashboards and global reports, overseeing the information needed by COEs such as: SLA - Service Level Agreement Tickets response and resolution time Tickets backlog and aging Customer satisfaction Demand status Company assets Solution We focused on centralizing data and increasing the amount of information available, from a macro level referring to management issues, as well as from a micro-level of operational nature. The project included creating advanced and user-friendly reports in Power BI to retrieve information from various sources of origin, including Remedyforce, ServiceNow, Inventory Management (Snow Inventory), Active Directory and Excel. We also helped the Group IT Services team to consolidate information on users and company assets which were key to having an efficient and standardized process in place for their IT daily operations. The solution consisted of building Power BI dashboards to enable data combination between three different systems that contained helpful information but were working independently up to the moment. Combining data from Active Directory, Office365, and Snow Inventory in the right way, brought more visibility around how to polish their work.

    "content": "Home Insights Transforming GNB Paraguay’s platform: From dual cores to a unified CRM Case study July 16, 2025 Transforming GNB Paraguay’s platform: From dual cores to a unified CRM Two banking cores, two data models, and one big challenge to solve. Unifying them created the momentum GNB needed to migrate to Dynamics 365 and prepare for a cloud-first future. Service Microsoft About the company Banco GNB Paraguay (former BBVA) has been operating for more than 100 years as an important contributor to the financial system. Their Universal Banking model aims to cater to all sectors of the economy, concentrating on Commercial Banking and Personal Banking by offering a wide variety of products and services supported by a highly efficient technological platform. Challenge With the merger between BBVA Paraguay and GNB Paraguay, it was necessary to update their Microsoft Dynamic CRM platform to the most recent version, Dynamics 365 v9.0 (On-Premises). With Microsoft Dynamics CRM, GNB has the power to scale and support its internal processes and achieve its strategies. One of the biggest challenges of the project was operating with two different banking cores simultaneously. Ready to face the challenge, and after 5 years of working with BBVA developing processes, we hit the ground running, migrating and unifying processes in sales, customer service, and operations among others. Solution After careful evaluation of GNB’s needs, the team needed to find a solution to run two different banking cores simultaneously. To achieve this, an intermediate database was implemented to unify the data models of both cores into one that was compatible with Dynamics. Tero by Nortal assigned a team of Dynamics consultants and experts to facilitate the platform migration to Dynamics 365 as well as to incorporate and adjust existing integrations. In order to execute a smooth transition, the project was divided into 4 phases, with the roll-up carried out incrementally. Migrating to the latest version made further facilities integration with other systems possible. We helped GNB implement hybrid online-on-premise solutions so that they could make the most out of Power Platform’s capabilities and prepare for a total transition to the cloud in the future. The updated interface was more intuitive for users and included features such as improved security and performance, as well as enhanced 360 views of clients. These are just a handful of reasons why migrating platforms was the right path for GNB. With us as their tech partner, GNB Paraguay seamlessly unified its banking platforms and prepared for a future total cloud transition. Project highlights Dashboards & Reports Data Migration Integration Tech stack Dynamics 365 Power Platforms Results Migrating to Dynamics 365 enabled further integration with other systems, including Office 365, Azure, Power BI, and more. The updated interface improved user experience, security, and performance The hybrid solution facilitated a plug-and-play connection with various platforms, preparing for a future total cloud transition.

    "content": "Home Insights ServiceNow® AI blueprint: Issue Auto Resolution Article April 28, 2025 by Pablo Larrosa, Vice President of Technology ServiceNow® AI blueprint: Issue Auto Resolution Issue Auto Resolution (IAR) helps organizations enable employees to put in a request in their own natural language and receive a fast response, avoiding triage bottlenecks. Service ServiceNow Last year, with the Xanadu release, ServiceNow® introduced several AI features that seamlessly integrate with the whole platform. From machine learning for automation intelligence to virtual agent natural language understanding (NLU). One of the standout capabilities is Issue Auto Resolution, a virtual agent designed to proactively resolve issues. How does Issue Auto Resolution work? When a user creates an issue, the IAR application uses advanced machine learning and NLU to assess the issue's criticality and intent. Then, it selects the most appropriate virtual agent topic for automatic resolution. If an exact virtual agent topic isn't available, Issue Auto Resolution performs an AI search to find the most relevant knowledge articles, FAQ, or catalog content. The deflection information is then delivered to the user through their preferred communication channel, such as email, SMS, or virtual agent. User journey in Issue Auto Resolution 1. Someone creates a ticket. 2. The platform assigns the incident to a virtual agent. 3.1. If a virtual agent finds a matching topic, it responds automatically. 3.2. If a virtual agent topic isn’t found, IAR uses AI search for relevant articles, FAQ, or catalog content. Set the foundations for IAR To gain the best performance for any AI solution out there, you need to have quality data that the model can lean on—complete data, with no inconsistencies, misspellings, or incorrect values. To train the model for IAR, ServiceNow recommends at least 10,000 incidents. Another thing to take into consideration is that not every solution is available for every ServiceNow deployment architecture. For example, you can’t use IAR in a self-hosted environment; you need to enable it in a customer instance. None of the AI features can be enabled in a personal dev instance. To analyze if a feature could be beneficial, contact your vendor and ServiceNow sales rep to define the next steps. Key metrics for evaluating IAR impact This agent can proactively resolve issues for ​ITSM and HR, improve the mean time to resolution (MTTR), and improve employee experience. Another key metric that has a direct impact is the first contact resolution rate, which indicates the percentage of problems that are resolved by first-level IT support. It’s also good practice to identify the change in the number of tickets handled by the helpdesk team after enabling the agent. Roadblocks for implementation There are some scenarios that aren’t suited to this solution, such as ServiceNow instances that are heavily customized with several legacy systems. Before pursuing this AI tool, define your phase zero to identify your starting point and desired roadmap. Security considerations IT handles vast amounts of data, from password reset requests to computer hardware issues. They also manage data related to applications, infrastructure, and services. The data assets stored in the configuration management database (CMDB) include information about the organization's internal infrastructure and IT-related assets, such as server models, OS versions, patch levels, dependencies, and IP addresses. This key configuration data could be easily used to identify vulnerabilities in a system. To stay proactive against attacks, detailed maps of corporate infrastructure should be considered sensitive information. For this reason, it is vital to properly protect all data stored in the CMDB at all times. The main challenge with virtual agents Nowadays, every platform brings its own out-of-the-box agent, like Salesforce Einstein Agent, Microsoft Copilot, and others. In our experience, not all of them are ideal for a production environment and can’t solve every need. You will need to decide if it’s worth building a homegrown AI solution for sentiment analysis or better to wait for the next version of the platform AI agent. We can assist in analyzing, comparing, and defining the roadmap. Taking productivity and ROI into account means that decision isn’t easy—let us help.

    "content": "Home Insights Generative AI app development: From idea to real business impact Article October 1, 2025 Generative AI app development: From idea to real business impact Generative AI (GenAI) offers extraordinary promise, but turning that promise into tangible business results demands more than technology. It requires a strategy rooted in real-world challenges, guided by a deep understanding of what works and what doesn’t. Service Data and AI Generative AI This article is based on our white paper How to create high-value GenAI apps: A Nortal guide. Here, we will share highlights about creating flexible, future-proof architectures and identifying use cases where Generative AI delivers meaningful value­. Along the way, we’ll examine the missteps that companies often make and the lessons learned from those who succeed. What is Generative AI application development? Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that generates new, original content based on learned patterns and context. Applications utilizing generative AI leverage large language models (LLMs), vision models, and other advanced techniques to provide functionalities such as conversational chatbots, document analysis, AI agents, and image recognition systems. Traditional AI and machine learning (ML) typically involve training models for specific tasks like classification, regression, or anomaly detection. In contrast, Generative AI applications often utilize pre-trained large-scale models (like GPT, Gemini, or Claude) to understand and generate contextually relevant outputs. This capability allows Generative AI systems to dynamically interact with users, synthesize insights from extensive document collections, and interpret complex visual data. Key components of a successful GenAI app In the current landscape, we have found that the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is the most powerful for solving business problems. To solve most of these issues, we supplement the basic RAG app architecture with a variety of other components. The structure of RAG genAI apps is shown in the following graphic: What is RAG architecture? RAG is an AI framework that improves LLMs by combining real-time data retrieval from external sources with generative models. It’s the link between static LLM knowledge and dynamic data, and it’s perfect for domain-specific tasks. This translates into more accurate, context-aware responses for AI apps. This model works extremely well for business applications because LLMs are built on vast amounts of publicly available data, making them powerful but inherently generalized. They don’t understand the specifics of your business, so we use RAG to bridge the gap. The key to making the RAG approach work is the process of deciding what company-specific content to add to the prompt. Searching and finding the most relevant documents is a crucial task, one that is often powered by vector databases that store embeddings of company-specific data and documents. The importance of contextual data RAG plays a vital role in making your business-specific data accessible to LLMs. When the right documents are identified and added to the original prompts, RAG gives the LLM access to the precise context it needs to respond with insights that align directly with your operations and goals. This involves building a vector database that acts as a knowledge repository, enabling the LLM to provide accurate and context-aware responses. Think of it as creating a specialized knowledge base that allows the LLM to speak your business language. Step-by-step Generative AI app development process Identifying the highest value use cases Selecting the right use cases is the foundation of any successful Generative AI implementation. Focus first on areas where Generative AI can deliver immediate, tangible value. These early successes provide a roadmap for scaling Generative AI across your organization and refining its role as your needs evolve. Some examples are: Streamlining workflows Democratizing access to information Enhancing data management Automating content generation The best use cases for your organization will depend on its unique goals and challenges. Set up tech-agnostic architecture Adaptability is the foundation of a successful Generative AI application. Think of your system as a vessel built for discovery, ready to chart uncharted waters. Its navigation systems, sails, and rigging are modular, allowing you to adjust course and adapt as conditions change or better tools become available. With this approach, you can: Plan for evolution from day 0 Confidently compare models like Azure, OpenAI, or Gemini Control costs Adapt to your industry’s demands A modular system allows you to evaluate and adopt models based on the factors that matter most: data governance, security, performance, cost, or industry-specific requirements. Healthcare applications, for instance, often demand a degree of precision that leaves no room for error. In contrast, marketing may prioritize creativity and speed over absolute accuracy. Each use case presents its own challenges, and your architecture must adapt to meet them without compromise. Test and compare results across models in your architecture To find the right fit for your use case, start with a clear definition of your desired outcomes. Rigorous benchmarking is essential. Test different models against real-world scenarios to determine which delivers the best results. Custom LLMs may seem appealing but are rarely necessary. Publicly available models, such as Azure OpenAI, ChatGPT-4o, or those offered by Anthropic, are improving rapidly and often present significant cost advantages. Focus your efforts on evaluating these options in controlled settings rather than investing in tailored solutions prematurely. We emphasize the value of evaluating model performance under real-world conditions. For example, in one project for character recognition, we tested different AI services for use by a gas meter company, including Azure OpenAI ChatGPT-4o and another Microsoft model built specifically for OCR. This hands-on approach revealed which model could handle the unique demands of the application most effectively—it was actually the more generalized model that did the best job. Such evaluations are critical for aligning technology choices with business goals. Mature GenAI apps for business use cases To support high-value use cases in a business context, the core RAG applications are generally supplemented by the following layers to provide a complete solution. Layers in a RAG application The architecture of a mature GenAI app to support high-value business use cases goes beyond a simple RAG application and must include a variety of elements as shown above. For a GenAI app to go fully into production for mission-critical use cases, all these elements must work together. Best tools for Generative AI software development The landscape of GenAI development tools is rapidly evolving, with a growing ecosystem of frameworks and services designed to accelerate the creation of AI-powered applications. While traditional ML engineering remains largely Python-centric, Generative AI development has seen a strong rise in TypeScript and Node.js adoption, particularly among web developers. Frameworks like LangChain and the OpenAI SDK offer robust support for both Python and JavaScript ecosystems, enabling flexibility across different tech stacks. Next.js, developed by Vercel, has emerged as a powerful framework for building AI-driven web applications. Vercel’s AI SDK further enhances this by providing streamlined integration with LLMs and rich UI components for conversational interfaces. Major cloud providers such as AWS (Bedrock) and Azure (Azure AI) are also actively expanding their toolsets to support generative AI development. These platforms offer comprehensive services for deploying, managing, and scaling AI agents, and they integrate well with vector databases—an essential component in building RAG systems. Common pitfalls to avoid We have identified several critical missteps that businesses often encounter when adopting Generative AI. Avoiding these mistakes can mean the difference between a costly experiment and a breakthrough success. Skipping proof of concept Jumping straight into full implementation without validating requirements can lead to costly missteps. A well-designed POC is an opportunity to test assumptions about the problem you’re solving and the results you expect to achieve. By working with a controlled dataset and clearly defining success metrics, you can evaluate whether Generative AI delivers the value you’re after. This step also helps identify potential issues, such as insufficient data, and accurately estimate costs before scaling up. Building unnecessary custom models Custom models may seem like the ultimate solution, but they come with steep costs and complexity. In most scenarios, public LLMs paired with RAG techniques provide powerful, cost-effective alternatives. Reinventing the wheel should only be considered when essential to meeting unique business requirements. Ignoring hallucination protection Hallucinations happen when LLMs provide answers that are incorrect because the LLM made up an answer. In May 2024, an article from the Association for Computing Machinery reported that a hallucination leaderboard maintained by Vectara showed the rate of hallucinations was estimated at 2.5 to 8.5 percent for popular LLMs. In April 2025, that same leaderboard shows that the current rate is less than 3 percent for most of the big LLM vendors. For some applications, a certain level of hallucinations may be tolerable. For others where mission-critical answers are being generated, it makes sense to implement protective measures such as: Adding high-quality, relevant information to a prompt using RAG methods. Using advanced LLM prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting, which encourage the model to break down complex reasoning into smaller steps, making its thought process more transparent and reducing errors. Fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset specifically tailored to your application domain to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations within that context. Using confidence scoring for each generated response, allowing you to filter outputs with low confidence levels. Implementing fact-checking and validation checks to verify the factual accuracy of LLM outputs, especially when dealing with critical information. Real business impact: Use cases that work The excitement around Generative AI sometimes eclipses the need for a concrete strategy. Without a clear understanding of the business problem Generative AI is meant to solve or the specific ROI it is expected to deliver, projects risk becoming directionless and expensive. Success starts with knowing why the technology is being implemented. Using a GenAI app to find the right talent We collaborated with Microsoft’s AI Co-Innovation Labs to develop and integrate an AI-powered assistant that processes thousands of resumes. Our solution automatically ranks candidates based on their fit for job criteria. It allowed us to reduce hiring process time by 30% and cut delivery time in half for first-time viable candidates. Read more about this use case here . Transforming medical practice incorporation For a healthcare client headquartered in Houston, Texas, we developed an AI-powered copilot that transformed the process of medical practice incorporation. What once took weeks was reduced to days or mere hours. This streamlined automation led to a measurable increase in the number of new practices established, delivering immediate value to the client. LLM for entertainment applications In the entertainment industry, we worked with GrayMeta to design an application for media content management. Leveraging machine learning models and APIs, the solution introduced features like visual recognition, audio classification, and language detection, empowering companies such as HBO and Disney to navigate their media libraries with greater efficiency. Call centers as fertile ground for successful genAI apps Using generative AI to transcribe and summarize customer service calls in call centers leads to immediate and significant cost savings. Generative AI also improves customer follow-up by detecting cases where customers are dissatisfied. We use generative AI alongside other techniques to help categorize and cluster calls by the reasons customers are calling and the problems they are experiencing. With this system, we can quickly detect if customers are experiencing a problem with a particular product or service. Final thoughts: Building for ROI and scale Evaluating potential ROI for genAI apps A crucial part of focusing on the highest value use cases is being able to accurately estimate the ROI before development and to track it precisely after deployment. Calculating the ROI for generative AI requires a broader and more dynamic approach compared to traditional ROI measurements. This is due to the unique characteristics of generative AI, such as its continuous evolution, qualitative benefits, and the need for ongoing maintenance. Traditional ROI estimates typically focus on \"hard\" metrics, measuring cost savings and productivity gains over a set period. Our work in the field has taught us how generative AI must be measured differently because the apps create impact in multiple dimensions beyond typical cost savings or financial gains. Competitive differentiation: It is crucial to include qualitative measures, such as customer satisfaction and employee engagement, as part of the indicators. Faster analytics: The ability to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data has a qualitative effect on numerous processes. Cumulative benefits : Unlike traditional ROI, generative AI's benefits often build over time.This can improve brand image and customer retention.

Service Salesforce Platform optimization Discover how Salesforce Agentforce empowers marketing and customer engagement by turning traditional, one-way outreach into responsive, context-aware experiences. This platform integrates seamlessly into the broader Salesforce ecosystem — connecting data, intent signals, and automation to enable smarter, more personalized interactions at scale. Introducing Salesforce Agentforce What is Salesforce Agentforce? Agentforce components Communication with other assets What is Salesforce Agentforce? What is Salesforce Agentforce? Agentforce is a proactive, autonomous AI application that provides specialized, always-on support to employees and customers through tailored agents. In other words, it’s the platform that enables autonomous agents to respond to customers, execute complex tasks, integrate with your marketing tools, and collaborate autonomously with other agents. This communication is essential for keeping individual AI agents experts in their jobs. Maintainability and scalability are possible when keeping instructions and actions cohesive within specialized agents. Agentforce has become a key player for sales and marketing teams by streamlining automation, providing real-time data insights, fostering stronger customer relationships, and boosting productivity. You can equip Agentforce with any necessary business knowledge to execute tasks according to its specific role. This platform is integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem, making the work with other assets, like the Einstein Trust Layer, the MuleSoft API management platform, or Salesforce Flow, smooth. These connections extend the work of existing Salesforce users and unify and harmonize customers' data for grounding precise and context-aware responses. Learn more about how Salesforce enables agent-to-agent communication here . Agentforce components Agentforce components Agentforce contains several components that can be useful in different situations. For instance, when creating a new agent, we can use the Agent Builder, a feature that enables users to customize, set up, test, and activate agents with an Agent Wizard and low-code tools. Used alongside the Testing Center, a functionality that enables teams to test Agentforce using synthetically generated data at scale, we get the most accurate outcome according to our goals. These components might also come in handy afterwards: Agentforce Service Agent: Customer-facing autonomous AI agent that helps deliver self-service resolution to customers with pre-built topics and actions for key service use cases. Atlas Reasoning Engine: It autonomously analyzes data, makes decisions, and completes complex multi-step tasks intelligently. Communication with other assets Communication with other assets Since Agentforce is a new layer that is already integrated into the Salesforce platform, users will find it easy to leverage other platform assets, including: Customer 360 applications (Sales, Service, Marketing, and Commerce Cloud) communicate with Agentforce to extend and augment the work of existing Salesforce users. Data Cloud helps Agentforce connect, unify, and harmonize customer data and metadata for grounding precise and context-aware responses. Data Cloud retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities enable users to upload unstructured data for further grounding. Tableau helps Agentforce see and understand data. The Einstein Trust Layer protects customer data using security features and guardrails such as zero data retention, toxicity detection, secure data retrieval, and dynamic grounding. The AI agent benefits from the Trust Layer Audit Trail, since it lets users track actions and outputs for compliance. The MuleSoft API management platform allows developers and admins to bring in third-party data, which allows Agentforce to work across any system. Salesforce Flow benefits Agentforce by invoking any process created in Flow Builder, the low-code process automation tool, so users can create new flows to support specific Agentforce jobs. Slack also helps Salesforce users deploy Agentforce within its conversational interface for employee-facing autonomous agents. Introducing Salesforce Agentforce What information do you need to configure an agent on Agentforce? In order to work properly, each agent in Agentforce needs the following specifications: Role: It defines the job to be done and the broader goals the agent should achieve on your team. Trusted data: This is the information the agent needs to carry out its role. This could include company knowledge articles, CRM data, external data via Data Cloud, public websites, and so on. Actions: These are the predefined tasks an agent can execute to do its job based on a trigger or instruction. For example, it could run a flow, prompt template, or Apex. Guardrails: They define what the agent can and cannot do. These can be natural-language instructions to escalate to a human or could come from built-in security features in the Einstein Trust Layer. Channels: The applications where agents can perform. They can be your website, CRM, mobile app, Slack, and more. What are the benefits of using Agentforce? Agentforce agents use automation and the Salesforce platform to improve work processes. Each agent has specific roles and serves as an extension of your team. Using this tool can improve overall efficiency, as Agentforce can automate repetitive tasks, including administrative duties, and reduce reliance on manual labor. Another benefit of using Agentforce is that businesses can lower operational costs while maintaining quality and output. AI agents provide 24/7 support and can handle 90–99% of customer inquiries related to product availability, order management, appointment scheduling, and more. Their replies come from reliable sources, like your company's knowledge or CRM data. Use Agentforce to deliver quick and accurate responses to your customers’ inquiries while conveying your brand's personality with coherence across every channel. These agents can also personalize replies for each customer. This level of customization typically boosts satisfaction, increases engagement, and reduces churn. The quick response times ensure that customers receive the necessary information right when they need it. Furthermore, you could build an AI agent that can identify and prioritize leads , serving as key support for sales teams. Agentforce can also act as a sales coach trained in your best practices, chatting with your sales representatives, addressing their questions and objections, and offering hands-on tips. This type of work alone could boost sales by about 20% and increase ROI by nearly 30% in the retail industry. Regarding content creation , Agentforce agents can streamline every stage, from research and briefing to content writing. Their ability to adapt to your brand's voice and process large amounts of data allows them to draft high-quality copy, potentially leading to: Better marketing outcomes Time and cost savings Brand consistency across channels Higher engagement Increased conversions Improved visibility in search results Marketing teams may also use AI agents to refine their copy before it goes live. With Agentforce, organizations can deliver hyper-personalized experiences at every stage of the buyer's journey. Its agents leverage customer data to drive engagement, suggest tailored solutions, and create content that resonates with your audience. Unlike previous AI models, Agentforce agents do not treat customer interactions as isolated events. Instead, they draw from the Salesforce ecosystem to customize offerings based on the customer's profile. Agentforce benefits summary Process automation: Forget about repetitive tasks, like administrative duties, and reduce manual work while improving efficiency. Team augmentation: Agents act as extensions of your team with specific roles and functions. Cost reduction: Using these agents drops operational costs without compromising quality and output. 24/7 support: Agentforce handles 90–99% of customer inquiries reliably by building their answers with information from your company’s knowledge and CRM data.

Marketing benefits: Better marketing outcomes Time and cost savings Consistent brand messaging Higher engagement and conversions Improved search visibility Context-aware interactions: Uses Salesforce data to provide holistic customer engagement instead of isolated interactions. How Agentforce helps marketers Agentforce allows marketers to forge deeper relationships, from personalized conversations to proactive retention strategies. Reduce customer turnover with proactive, personalized promotions Retaining customers is just as important as acquiring new ones, especially when they may be at risk of churning. If a customer’s churn score nears a threshold, reaching out with an exclusive loyalty discount or renewal incentive guides them through the redemption process. How does it work? Agents can identify these at-risk customers by analyzing specified churn indicators, such as low engagement or decreased purchase frequency, and autonomously send a tailored promotion based on their profile and the guardrails set by the marketer. The outcome Agents help identify where to rekindle interest and engagement before the customer decides to leave, and reach out proactively to avoid it. These AI-powered retention strategies boost customer lifetime value, reduce churn, and foster brand loyalty. With minimal manual effort, Agentforce helps marketers stay connected to customers who might otherwise drift away. By building agents to implement these use cases, marketers can increase customer engagement, boost conversions, and build deeper, lasting relationships. Automate customized, two-way conversations on messaging apps Interacting one-on-one with every customer responding to a promotional campaign on messaging apps, such as WhatsApp or SMS, is a tall order for any marketing team. How does it work? Imagine a customer receives an exclusive offer for a product they’ve shown interest in. Historically, there have been limited chatbot capabilities that typically only use keywords or have no ability to respond to a WhatsApp message at all. With Agentforce, you can enable a customer-facing, autonomous agent that acts like a personal concierge. The customer reaches out with a question, and an agent instantly responds with tailored product recommendations, current offers, or even information on complementary products. If the customer decides to make a purchase, the agent can guide them through the entire checkout process, from completing the transaction to sending order status and updates. If additional help is needed, the agent smoothly transfers the conversation to a human service representative, maintaining continuity. The outcome This approach not only boosts conversions by keeping customers engaged, but it also builds satisfaction and loyalty through timely, relevant responses. By reducing support team load, Agentforce helps deliver a consistent brand experience that feels truly personal and seamless. Improve customer journeys with intelligent reprioritization Keeping your audience engaged while respecting their communication preferences can be a balancing act. Before customers reach their communication limit, reassign them to the most relevant journey based on both their interests and your business goals. How does it work? Marketers can ensure high-value content is delivered at the right time by reprioritizing messaging without overwhelming customers. Also, by adapting dynamically to customer behavior, Agentforce helps ensure every interaction is relevant, so customers stay engaged with your brand. For example, if a customer is close to their communications cap, use Agentforce for Marketing to prioritize an upcoming product announcement or a VIP event invitation, aligning customer interests with timely opportunities for engagement. The outcome This leads to higher conversion rates, lower unsubscribe rates, and stronger customer relationships. Capture and qualify leads effortlessly on your website In order to avoid self-guided experiences for the visitor, which often result in opportunities to bounce before becoming a lead or talking to a sales representative, you can use Agentforce to welcome them with tailored product or service recommendations, offer exclusive content, and capture contact information. How does it work? Depending on visitor behavior, the agent can suggest gated assets such as case studies and demo videos or even register someone for an event or webinar. For highly engaged prospects, the agent can schedule follow-up meetings with sales reps, ensuring they receive immediate value without friction. The outcome This proactive, conversational approach nurtures leads by guiding them to the right solutions based on their needs and interests. By keeping visitors engaged and moving seamlessly through the pipeline, Salesforce Agentforce for Marketing nurtures leads naturally, resulting in higher-quality opportunities for ultimately loyal customers.

    "content": "Home Insights Understanding agent-to-agent (A2A) communication Article June 4, 2025 by Gabriel Juarez, Salesforce Tech Lead and Micaela Vidart, Technical Support Representative Understanding agent-to-agent (A2A) communication Service Platform optimization Salesforce What is agent-to-agent (A2A) communication? In simple terms, agent-to-agent (A2A) communication is the communication system that allows autonomous AI agents to interact seamlessly. On the other hand, sources like Wallarm and Lisowski refer to A2A Protocol as a cross-platform specification for enabling AI agents to interact with each other and complete tasks. In other words, we can describe A2A communication as a universal meeting room where every AI is invited and speaks the same structured language. Just like humans use languages (English, Italian, Spanish), AI agents communicate using A2A protocol as their common language to work together like a well-coordinated team. A2A communication induces a significant shift in organizational operations by collaborating and delegating tasks across heterogeneous systems. Now, companies can enhance workflows, reduce manpower dependency, and improve decision-making capabilities. How does A2A communication work? Let’s imagine a company related to the distribution of printed and digital study material has a high demand for support and order tracking. Due to the massive volume of items sold and the seasonal load, managing customer inquiries fast is humanly impossible. As a customer-centric company, customer experience is a top priority, and it needs to be easy for clients to contact support. Here's where AI agents and A2A communication turn up: they need to process different types of requests, understand the sentiment, and generate personalized responses. Internally, AI agents reroute the questions to domain-specific agents or involve humans in the loop. Different LLMs are used for specific tasks, like summarizing the content of long texts or documents and later locating references of order numbers. These AI agents not only provide quick responses, but they also enrich cases with information so that employees have more decision-driving data in complex scenarios. Let’s see a few additional use cases: Imagine an online shopping portal. A customer's order placement on the portal triggers automatic communication between the portal’s software and that of managing inventory. The silent exchange under review ensures apt order processing and inventory revisions, demonstrating a prime example of A2A interaction. Another use case comes when we picture two applications—let’s call them App A and App B. App A possesses a specific feature that App B requires. The need to construct this feature anew in App B is circumvented through APIs; by utilizing the API from App A, App B can gain access to the desired feature, enabling the A2A interaction. What’s the difference between A2A communication and human-to-machine communication? A2A communication diverges from standard, human-to-machine exchanges. In the latter, a human user interacts with software to carry out a specific task, like document editing or internet browsing. Contrarily, agent-to-agent hinges on direct software-to-software conversations to execute tasks, with no human involvement required. The resulting workflow speeds up task completion, lowering the probability of human error in the process. It’s clear that A2A communication has emerged as a cornerstone in present-day computing systems. It earned its spot through enabling various software platforms to interact in a seamless, integrated fashion, making significant contributions to a wide range of digital systems. Here’s a summary. Feature A2A Communication Human-to-machine communication Participants Autonomous AI agents Human user and a machine/AI system Interaction model Fully automated: peer-to-peer, agent collaboration Requires human interaction: client-server or user-agent interaction Purpose AI agents collaborate on complex tasks Human directs or queries the machine Interface APIs, system calls, data protocols UI/UX, voice input, keyboard, etc. Communication style Conversational, iterative, adaptive Command-response, often single-turn Protocols/standards Standardized protocols like JSON-RPC 2.0 Varies, often proprietary or UI-based Use cases System integrations, data sync Chatbots, command interfaces, voice assistants Examples Multiple AI agents coordinating workflows; SAP ↔ Salesforce Human uses a chatbot or voice assistant; User asks Siri to play music Introducing Salesforce Agentforce What is Salesforce Agentforce?

Refine copies before going live Agentforce can leverage customer data to drive engagement, suggest tailored solutions, and create content that resonates with your audience. How Salesforce enables agent-to-agent communication Agentforce is a top leader in streamlining operations with AI agents across organizations, whether it’s for marketing, sales, customer service, or beyond. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with applications within the Salesforce ecosystem. But enterprise platforms have become more complex, and more often than not they need to interact with third-party apps and external services like market analysis tools or payment systems. From low code to pro code, Salesforce Platform provides the appropriate tools for each use case, whether simple or advanced. Flow Builder will become your best partner for orchestrating communications among agents and even talking to external systems. These invocations can move in both directions, either by enriching agents’ chat capabilities or by leveraging GenAI power from your existing flows. A great way to make agents talk to each other and distribute the efforts is through flows. In one example, an agent is asked to provide information about the latest touchpoints with a customer. As this agent is not the specialist, it will invoke a flow to reroute the question to one or multiple dedicated agents. This way you can chain many steps and transform an inconvenient or dead-end task into a collaborative effort among autonomous agents. References “Agentforce: The AI Agent Platform.” Salesforce.

    "content": "Case study June 29, 2023 infraVelo: Secure bicycle parking spaces for a more mobile Berlin Service Atlassian Cloud Transformation Technology and Engineering Seamless Experiences Industry Public Sector GB infraVelo GmbH is a subsidiary of the state-owned Grün Berlin GmbH and acts as a partner for the state of Berlin. infraVelo supports the state of Berlin and its districts in strengthening eco-friendly transport and in creating climate-friendly structures and services for cyclists, pedestrians, and public transport users, making Berlin an even more livable city. In Berlin, infraVelo has developed ParkYourBike, a simple booking, access, and billing system for secure bicycle parking facilities. Cyclists can use the app to find secure bicycle parking facilities near them and park their bikes in a bicycle box or collective garage. They have full control over their reservations, parking, and payments using their smartphones. Efficient service and support processes with various input channels and service providers To improve parking facilities for cyclists, the first secure bicycle parking facility in the state of Berlin was opened at Schöneberg Town Hall in the Tempelhof-Schöneberg district, which can be used via the ParkYourBike booking, access, and billing system. The ParkYourBike pilot project with 64 bicycle boxes has been running there since the end of November 2022. Further locations in the city will follow. In addition to the technical development of the system, infraVelo also set up service and support structures for users. The introduction of a service management tool was necessary to provide support. The tool must bundle the competencies of all service providers to ensure smooth processes between the different support levels. The systems are used daily by the internal and external service and support units of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level s . Introduction of a ticket system with Atlassian ' ’ s Jira Service Management Cloud With the help of the Atlassian Cloud tool Jira Service Management, a ticket system was introduced that covers all input channels used by infraVelo for service requests or error reports (email, phone call, contact form). Tickets are automatically created when an email is received or a contact form is submitted. For telephone support, we standardized the process of creating tickets for both error reports and service requests and introduced it at the call center service provider. These measures, along with uniform workflows, facilitate the efficient creation and processing of tickets. infraVelo employees were trained in the configuration and use of the Jira Service Management tool. Jan Faißt, Project Lead, Nortal AG: \" As an enthusiastic cyclist and supporter of better cycling conditions in Berlin, providing consulting services was truly a labor of love for me. Working on the project with infraVelo was a very friendly, goal-oriented, and successful experience .\" What we have delivered Expert services Set up and configuration of Jira Service Management Cloud Configuration of complex contractually agreed SLAs (service level agreements), as well as their tracking and reporting Support in connecting a contact form with different input channels (smartphone app and website) to the Jira service management tool via Rest API Methodological services Conducting workshops to identify requirements Holding joint working meetings to support the implementation of requirements Hybrid project management Establishing a communication structure for continuous monitoring of the project goal Exchanging best practices and empowering employees to configure and use the Jira Service Management tool Falk Bandow, IT service management, ParkYourBike „ Together with Nortal , we were able to achieve great project success. Nortal helped us set up the ticket system and adapt it to our requirements and wishes in a short period of time.

We are proud to announce that Nortal has been selected as a supplier under NATO’s Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) program. Finnish technology magazine Tivi interviewed our CEO of Nortal Finland, Harri Vepsäläinen , about Nortal’s acceptance into the program. – Harri Vepsäläinen, CEO at Nortal Finland The defense sector has been more cautious than the rest of the public sector in moving forward with digitalization, but this is now changing. Vepsäläinen explains how the increasing complexity of security threats has significantly grown the need for data-driven solutions in the defense sector. He comments that Nortal has a lot to offer NATO: “We have a proven track record in public sector digital transformation, and we can pass on the best practices from other public sector digital implementations to the defense sector.” Vepsäläinen continues by noting that the NATO connection will shift the direction of our business to some extent. At the time of the announcement of our BOA contract , we also revealed our intention to focus strongly on the defense sector across all our core markets. – Harri Vepsäläinen, CEO at Nortal Finland We have invested in defense sector expertise, with people from the sector joining us, including an admiral from the British Navy. Finally, Vepsäläinen explains how we established our capabilities in the defense sector last year. We realized that we have defense expertise in the Middle East, the Baltics, and the UK, which would be valuable to bring together under one umbrella, and we set out to develop the sector as a unified entity. While we have business in the U.S. and other regions, Vepsäläinen mentions that the defense side of the company will focus on Europe and the Middle East in this first phase.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward advancing next-generation defense technologies. Nortal will contribute its extensive experience in digital transformation, software development, and the integration of complex systems. Hanwha’s field-proven Redback IFV platform will serve as the foundation for a new, highly advanced system designed for integration with multiple platforms. SensusQ will contribute its unique domain and technological expertise, shaped by operational experience in Ukraine and NATO countries. “This MOU is about building a genuine security partnership. By collaborating with esteemed Estonian companies, we are committed to contributing to the growth of the local and European defence industry,\" said Kim Dong-hyun, Head of the LS Business Division at Hanwha Aerospace. Within their strategic collaboration framework, the companies are exploring initial partnership opportunities with Estonia and other Central and Eastern European countries to develop a pioneering BMS tailored to their operational and technological needs. “Together, we are building the foundation for long-term, trusted international cooperation to meet the evolving challenges of modern warfare. This BMS can help defence forces achieve digital supremacy by preventing, countering, and responding to hybrid threats with faster response times and reduced operational costs, harnessing seamless integration and interoperability,” said Peeter Smitt, Business Area Director for Defence at Nortal. “This partnership marks a significant milestone for Estonia’s defence industry. By combining Hanwha Aerospace’s advanced platform with the agility and innovation of Estonian software companies, we are shaping the next generation of Battlefield Management Systems tailored to the operational needs of modern armies. For SensusQ, it is both an honour and a responsibility to contribute our expertise in situational awareness and decision-support solutions,” added Villiko Nurmoja, Co-Founder of SensusQ. BMS is an essential tool for military operations, providing integrated information acquisition and processing to enhance command and control. It provides near real-time flow of information to tactical commanders, allowing for the sharing of battalion-level combat information across the battlefield. Through this partnership, Hanwha, Nortal, and SensusQ are pioneering a next-generation BMS that will combine real-time, multi-domain decision support, automated intelligence processing, and secure, coalition-ready interoperability. The system is being designed with a modular, non-monolithic architecture, enabling rapid capability integration, allied system compatibility, and long-term scalability to meet the operational demands of future high-tempo warfare.

    "title": "Application automatically allocates consultation rooms at TYKS Compass Hospital and in the Salo unit – reducing the need for space by up to 30–40%",
    "content": "Tag list News Press releases Finnish IT media Tivi reports on Nortal’s cooperation with the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland and the rollout of the Space Resource Management application at TYKS Compass Hospital and in the Salo psychiatric unit. In the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland’s new psychiatric hospital at TYKS Compass Hospital, a multi-space environment model was introduced in autumn 2024. Under this model, healthcare professionals do not have dedicated consultation rooms; instead, rooms are allocated based on the varying needs of outpatient care. This approach is based on a new method of space utilization introduced in spring 2023 at the psychiatric unit of the Salo IOT Campus. This model has proven effective in promoting more efficient use of facilities. One common issue that leads to rooms standing empty in hospital facilities occurs when an employee works in the unit only a few days a week and has a personal room that remains unused by other staff members and patients, yet it remains vacant. As a result of the new operating model, the hospital can provide the same volume of services as before while requiring 30–40% fewer consultation rooms. More efficient use of space helps prevent oversized premises and their costs. This approach ensures optimal space utilization for patient care, improves space efficiency, and leads to overall cost savings. “This is a truly extensive change in our ways of working and in our culture. I would compare it to replacing a 1970s car with an electric vehicle. Moving to a multi-space environment model is not only a general development trend in Finland, but we are also seeing the same phenomenon more broadly across the Nordic countries and even internationally. For it to work, it needs a user-centric application for managing space resources, built around actual space requirements and designed to make it easy to reserve rooms,” says Marko Muukka , Project Manager for Psychiatry at TYKS. To maximize the efficiency of the new facilities and ensure that the basic healthcare service processes function seamlessly under the latest model, the Compass Hospital and the psychiatric unit in Salo chose to adopt Nortal’s Space Resource Management application, a solution developed and tailored specifically for the social and healthcare sectors. “Our cooperation with Nortal has been smooth, and based on the experiences in Salo, it was well justified to introduce the Space Resource Management application at Compass Hospital as well. According to user feedback, the application’s technical use is very easy. Staff in the units can easily see their room bookings and find the most suitable consultation room. Without a functioning application, managing the hospital’s facilities would be impossible,” Muukka continues. Healthcare professionals using the facilities submit a booking request through the Space Resource Management application, after which the system prioritizes the requests and assigns rooms to users. Rooms are allocated to clinical staff based on predefined criteria derived from patient care needs, and the reserved space is reflected in both the users’ calendars and in the room-booking application. Since the rollout, the application’s room bookings have been monitored in line with the needs and objectives of clinical work. Based on user experience, the automatic room allocation has been further refined to better meet the specific needs of the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland’s psychiatric units. “In the traditional model, where healthcare professionals have their own designated rooms, the utilization rate and efficiency of care facilities have been at a low level. At TYKS Compass Hospital and the psychiatric unit in Salo, there are in total just over 100 consultation rooms and other function-critical spaces, and their use has been optimized for approximately 180 employees,” says Mikko Lehto , VP of Government and Health at Nortal.

    "title": "Ergin Tuganay in Talouselämä: who owns factory data? A new EU regulation is reshaping the balance of power",
    "content": "Service Data and AI Industry Manufacturing Industry In his opinion piece in Talouselämä, Tuganay highlights a shift that many industrial companies have yet to fully grasp. With the EU’s new Data Act now in force, manufacturers will gain a legally backed right to access operational data generated by the machines they purchase, lease, or use, including robots, cranes, and other equipment that has traditionally remained locked behind vendor-controlled interfaces. Tuganay stresses that this is far more than a technical update. The regulation has the potential to significantly transform cost efficiency, predictive maintenance, and overall competitiveness across Finnish industry. He points to studies such as McKinsey’s, which show that predictive maintenance can cut downtime by up to 50% and extend equipment lifetime by up to 40%, benefits that have long been out of reach due to fragmented data ownership and slow negotiations with equipment suppliers. However, he also emphasizes that the regulation introduces new ambiguities. Terms like “readily accessible” or “reasonable timeframe” are open to interpretation, which could push companies and suppliers into lengthy discussions instead of immediately putting data to work. He argues that this ambiguity makes preparation critical: companies must understand both their new rights and the obligations of their suppliers. – Ergin Tuganay, Head of Data & AI, Nortal Finland Organizations that stay alert and act now will be the ones to unlock the full value of industrial data. The greatest risk, Tuganay argues, is lack of action . Many Finnish companies recognize the Data Act by name but have not yet assessed what data they truly need or how accessing it could improve operations. Those who wait until the last minute may find themselves entering negotiations from a weak position, leaving considerable business value unrealized. Ultimately, Tuganay frames the Data Act as a potential competitive advantage for Finland’s industrial sector. However, realizing this benefit depends on early coordination among companies, suppliers, and technology partners around data standards and governance. Read the full opinion piece in Finnish in Talouselämä to explore Tuganay’s insights in depth.

    "title": "Tivi: Nortal establishes a business unit in Finland focused on data and AI – Ergin Tuganay appointed as head of the new unit",
    "content": "Tag list Data and AI News Press releases Finnish technology magazine Tivi reports on our newly established Data & AI business unit in Finland, headed by Ergin Tuganay , who has long held leadership roles at both Nortal Finland and our international operations. The growing need for organizations to leverage data and integrate artificial intelligence into daily business creates pressure to renew both operating models and technology architectures. This new unit responds to this demand by providing more comprehensive solutions to a broad range of clients and industries. By bringing together our expertise in consulting, modern platforms, data engineering, AI/ML, and analytics, it will strengthen our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions that improve efficiency, competitiveness, and innovation. “Many organizations in both the private and public sectors have vast amounts of data, but often lack the processes, platforms, and practices needed to turn that data into real business value. At the same time, the pressure to adopt artificial intelligence is increasing. Yet, effective use of AI requires high-quality data, clear governance models, and the capability to build AI-ready solutions. We are now addressing this need by providing our clients with a comprehensive service that covers strategic planning, implementation, and continuous development,” says Tuganay. The most pressing AI-related challenge for organizations today is how to harness data and artificial intelligence effectively to support their business. In practice, this can mean improving production quality, optimizing energy use, refining customer segmentation, enhancing sales monitoring, or developing new service models. In manufacturing, rising raw material costs, tariffs, and trade tensions are driving companies to find new ways to control expenses and remain competitive. Real-time data and AI can help anticipate failures, optimize processes, save energy, and improve worker safety, enabling solutions such as minimizing material waste, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, automated quality control, and predictive analytics for occupational safety. In addition to the private sector, data and artificial intelligence also offer significant opportunities in the public sector, both for improving citizen services and increasing the efficiency of administration. “In healthcare, predictive analytics can help identify service needs at an early stage, saving costs and promoting well-being. In government agencies, artificial intelligence can improve administrative processes, such as permit handling and resource allocation, freeing up staff time for more complex tasks,” Tuganay notes. In Finland, Nortal has traditionally been known as a digital partner for the industrial, energy, and public sectors. With the establishment of the new Data & AI business unit, we will now serve a broader range of clients and industries. “For a long time, we have been building solutions around data and IoT and helping our customers leverage artificial intelligence as part of their digitalization strategies. The newly established business unit further strengthens this expertise and provides our customers with a broader service model,” says Harri Vepsäläinen , CEO of Nortal Finland. The new business unit brings together our expertise across five core areas: data and AI consulting and governance models, modern technology platforms, data engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as business intelligence and analytics. The launch has already drawn attention in Finnish media, with coverage in both Tivi and ETN , highlighting the growing demand for AI adoption and our role in helping Finnish companies unlock the full value of their data.

    "content": "Home Insights Saudi Census 2022: a catalyst for data-driven decision-making Case study December 18, 2023 Saudi Census 2022: a catalyst for data-driven decision-making As governments around the world strive to meet the needs of their citizens and adapt to a rapidly changing world, it is essential that the decisions they make are informed by accurate and complete data. Saudi Arabia’s innovative, predominantly digital, 2022 Census is widely viewed as one of the most accurate ever conducted in the Kingdom. Service eCensus Strategy and Transformation Technology and Engineering Industry Government Real-Time Economy e-Census and Statistics The 2022 Census was the fifth carried out in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and a vital component for delivering on the goals of Saudi Vision 2030. High-quality data and statistics gathered through the Census, combined with data from other sources, will inform the Government’s evidenced-based decision making in the years to come. Making the great even better The 2022 Census marked a significant advancement from the 2010 Census and used innovative digital techniques and technologies at every stage of the process, from planning and data collection to analysis and communication. To meet the necessary high data standards, reforms introduced at the Saudi General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT), including a new statistical database, laid the foundations for a world-leading statistical office. Challenge End-to-end processing It was essential that the data delivered by the Census met a high level of quality and accuracy. Data would be collected from a range of sources beyond the traditional paper survey – GASTAT planned to use online forms and data from additional administrative sources. Making sure that all this data was collected, cleansed, and validated to create a high-quality data set, and then analyzed and presented in the most useful and valuable format, would require a superior end-to-end data processing engine. – Dr. Konrad Pesendorfer, General Supervisor of the Census and Chief Statistician, General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia I am glad to express my appreciation to Nortal for their excellent work in Saudi Census 2022 project, a cornerstone of the Saudi Vision 2030 national program. …Nortal team has been instrumental in the design and implementation of the robust and scalable data processing engine. Solution Reliable data, well presented Working closely with the GASTAT team and using our extensive experience of previous census projects, we created a data processing engine that met their needs exactly and was capable of several different data transformations. The data was cleansed, validated, and enriched to eliminate gaps before being prepared for presentation, along with the careful implementation of metadata to provide structure and context. Visualization of the Census results and allowing for further analysis of the data by internal and external GASTAT stakeholders was one of the most important elements of the project. We designed and developed more than 15 interactive dashboards and 200 output tables to support communication and analysis, as well as self-service search functionality that would allow the data to be analysed by internal users. We also created a Saudi Census portal, which features a wide range of interactive dashboards, easy-to-use interactive maps, reports, tables, and charts. The modern and intuitive user design creates an excellent experience that is suitable for external users, while internal users have the option of adding new portal products for additional bespoke analysis in the future. 800m records processed 12 administrative sources processed 95%+ data quality Result A national success The 2022 Saudi Census has been widely seen as one of the most accurate and comprehensive every carried out and its public launch in May 2023 was a national success. Conducted in line with the best international methodologies, the use of error monitoring and automated data correction techniques meant that data quality exceeded 95%. The Census has set a new benchmark in modern statistics. More than 800 million records from the survey results and almost a dozen other administrative sources were processed and presented in the form of interactive tables and dashboards. The results set out detailed data in three main categories: population, households, and housing. It found that the population of Saudi Arabia in 2022 was 32,175,244 – 58.4% of who are Saudis. – Faisal bin Fadel Al-Ibrahim, Minister of Economy and Planning Chairman of the Board of Directors, General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia The Saudi Census 2022 is an important national project, and its outputs will be a key pillar for planning and decision making, developing economic and social policy, creating development plans for various sectors and services, and supporting the investment environment in the Kingdom and achieving the Vision 2030 goals. Future-proof The 2022 Saudi Census has provided invaluable and reliable data for the Saudi Government as it works towards the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 and beyond. It has also reinforced the transformation of GASTAT, laying the foundations for the creation of digital registries and eventually, the ultimate prize, a fully digital statistical office. The Census dashboards and interactive maps can be explored on the Saudi Census 2022 website.

Seven years after the successful launch of InvestEasy, its game-changing portal for entrepreneurs, we worked with Oman’s Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion (MOCIIP), to create an even more future-ready, efficient and user-friendly service with the help of emerging technology. Making the great even better Over the past two decades, Oman’s ambitious path to digitalization has transformed the way its government provides services to citizens, businesses, investors, and visitors. The quality and ease of use of its digital services is widely recognized – Oman has risen up the ranks of the eGovernment Development Index from 98th place in 2003 to 50th place in 2022. The Sultanate’s first eGovernment initiative, the InvestEasy portal, was launched in 2015 and transformed the business environment in Oman almost overnight. In 2023, the portal was hugely successful and widely used, but in need of an upgrade to ensure it remained future-facing. Challenge Upgrading to face the future The Omani government was keen to optimize the Commercial Registration and activity licensing process, taking advantage of the latest developments in technology to make the process of setting up a business in Oman even more efficient and seamless. One of the most significant hurdles for foreign investors wishing to register a company in Oman was that InvestEasy could not be accessed without an officially issued PKI card. This prevented foreign investors from registering a new company online, or from managing their Oman companies online if they were already established. – HE Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef, Minister of Commerce, Industry & Investment Promotion, Sultanate of Oman We're making it even easier for businesses to thrive… I very much look forward to the impact of this exciting initiative and the part it will play in expanding and diversifying investment and participation in Oman’s vibrant economy. Solution Creating a people-centric experience We believe strongly that a people-centric approach is critical to the success of government e-services. The creation of a mobile app version of InvestEasy was crucial. This would allow users to access information on the Commercial Registration process and services such as the searchable National Business Registry on their phone. The development of biometric and facial recognition technology, combined with the mobile app, would allow foreign investors to register and authenticate to InvestEasy without the need for a PKI card. Finally, lease contract functionality would allow investors not only to register a company but to acquire an office lease contract seamlessly through the app. 3x simpler than the existing process 10x improvement in efficiency 30,000 foreign users expected to onboard Result The upgraded platform was launched in November 2023, rebranded as the Oman Business Platform and redesigned to reflect Invest Oman’s marketing language. New mobile app A new mobile app that supports KYC through biometrics and facial recognition allows foreign investors to register and authenticate to the platform without the need for a PKI card. The app allows users to check the availability of company names and trademarks, search for existing Commercial Registrations, and track the status of their applications. You can download the app here: Apple store | Google Play store Investment guide A comprehensive investment guide, also accessible through the app, sets out everything an investor needs to know about the process of registering a company in Oman, such as the required documents and fees, and likely timeline of any application. To inform and engage new investors even further, users are also able to simulate the process of opening a company on the app. New services The new platform makes starting a business in Oman even more efficient. The integration of two further government entities into the platform means that investors can now not only set up their business online, but search for and lease commercial space as part of the same process. Future-proof Oman’s experience has already shown that the right digital tools, applied properly, can transform the way a government interacts with its citizens and businesses. The Oman Business Platform clearly displays the three vital principles of a successful e-government service: A single point of contact and authentication for users. A people-centric approach, where services are relevant and the customer experience is intuitive and based around the user journey. Future facing – it is built with the future in mind. The result for investors and businesses in Oman is a more efficient, lower-cost experience, while the Government has the security of a future-proof, flexible and cost-effective infrastructure.

    "content": "Tag list Seamless Experiences Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Strategy and Transformation Government Transformation Witted has gathered the most interesting IT consulting companies from Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and their latest report shows that Nortal was one of the fastest-growing software consultancies in Finland in 2023. There was an unwritten societal and political understanding that a digital society is the only way forward for a country that needs to run the sovereign complexity while radically improving the business climate, enabling citizens and businesses to focus on their core progress, and hiding the complexity of the administration and taxation. The backdrop for the rapid transformation was a unique combination of unlimited political will, enthusiasm, and extremely limited budgets, creating a start-up-like culture and approach to digitalization. Three decades later, the resulting perfect storm has brought us to where Estonia is now – the first in the world to offer 99% of public services online 24/7, making the nation one of the world’s most trusted administrations. Nortal has been a driving force behind the strategic transformation and has since delivered 40% of what is collectively known as the Estonian e-government. – Priit Alamäe, CEO of Nortal Three decades later, the resulting perfect storm has brought us to where Estonia is now – the first in the world to offer 99% of public services online 24/7, making the nation one of the world’s most trusted administrations. Nortal has been a driving force behind the strategic transformation and has since delivered 40% of what is collectively known as the Estonian e-government. Estonia can be the inspiration for both “what” and “how” Whereas most of the world is stuck in digitalizing the processes built up over many years due to endless political compromises, Estonia focuses on the next chapter. The new goal is to entirely hide the complexity of the state apparatus from citizens and design the whole government-citizen-business interaction as a collection of well-orchestrated, socially inclusive proactive services that would enable real-time service-provision and communication in a non-intrusive manner. The first life-event-based proactive service was designed and built for family and parental benefits in 2019. Before this transformation, every application took state officials 65 minutes to process, and parents of a newborn had to understand and handle the administrative complexity. Now, they receive a proactive proposal from the government for the benefits they are entitled to. As the young parents leave the hospital, their parental support money is already transferred. Why should any citizen ever have to apply for a service they are clearly entitled to receive? That’s proactive, human-centric, fast, socially responsible, and efficient. That’s the path governments ought to take for their people and economy. – Priit Alamäe, CEO of Nortal Why should any citizen ever have to apply for a service they are clearly entitled to receive? That’s proactive, human-centric, fast, socially responsible, and efficient. That’s the path governments ought to take for their people and economy. Estonia can inspire both the “what” and “how.” The above-mentioned uncompromising approach is key in this context since one of the traps we have mostly managed to avoid is “yes, but.” More often than not, we see progress in digitalization in many countries stopping when the answer is “yes, but …”. What you typically hear from politicians and state officials is that the Estonian example is great, BUT it is much more challenging and complex in their own case – there is a legacy to build on, Estonia is much smaller, the structures are more complex, federalism does not allow it. Historical complexity should not be an excuse for stopping societal progress. When Estonia decided to go all-in on digital society, the majority of the people did not even have access to the internet. So, the decision-makers could have said “yes, but” and stopped there. – Priit Alamäe, CEO of Nortal When Estonia decided to go all-in on digital society, the majority of the people did not even have access to the internet. So, the decision-makers could have said “yes, but” and stopped there. Some principles apply to any organization going through a (digital) transformation: Strong political will, a clear vision, and commitment to change. Creation of trust for the system and social cohesion. Not using legacy as an excuse. Fast, iterative steps combined with learning-by-doing. Not making compromises that lead to mediocre outcomes. Of course, we hear the argument often that Estonia is a fraction of the size of, for example, the U.S. and that there is no point in comparing the two. This is simply not true. It is often actually the opposite. Regardless of whether a bank has 100,000 or 10,000,000 customers, the customers will expect the same quality of service to keep them loyal. Building a fully functional customer support system will be maybe 5x more expensive for the bigger bank due to scalability requirements, but definitely not 100x more. The cost per user, however, will still be significantly less for them. – Priit Alamäe, CEO of Nortal Of course, we hear the argument often that Estonia is a fraction of the size of, for example, the U.S. and that there is no point in comparing the two. This is simply not true. It is often actually the opposite. What to take across the Atlantic? For example, currently, only 2% of government forms are digitized in the U.S. – the question is not if but how and where to start transforming. Think about the citizen experience and let the expected outcome guide the process. Create faster response-time requirements for public authorities; restrictions on repetitive data collection (the once-only principle); shield the complexity of the state from the people and businesses; and use advancements in technology, data, and AI to create better and inclusive experiences for citizens. Establish lean methodologies and agile procurement mechanisms for fast prototyping and working in smaller steps. Always think outside in. If there is a choice to be made, let the back office suffer. Build on public-private partnerships because the government needs help to drive digital transformation. It can help set the direction and a single digital infrastructure that is accessible to all. However, the speed and depth of digital transformation in any given society can only be achieved through a coordinated effort with the private sector. Of all the digital transactions that a person might have in one month, only a small part will be tied to the government. – Priit Alamäe, CEO of Nortal Think about the citizen experience and let the expected outcome guide the process. Most importantly, fight the “but” and start finding solutions instead of problems. The right reform is painful only in the short term for some parts of society but beneficial for citizens and the economy in the long term. Change is difficult, especially in sectors with solid traditions and significant inertia: the public sector, education, and healthcare. It often requires a kamikaze-like steadfastness to champion and complete the reforms that force people to work and act in new ways. Technology is not a limiting factor to this change – missing decisiveness is. The Estonian example shows that the outcome of digitalization is not digital processes but increased transparency, reduced corruption, economic advancement, and public approval. If we continue accepting the but , the lives of most citizens and enterprises will remain deprived of the progress and efficiency enjoyed in other countries, and the local economy will be left behind. Estonia’s example can help, almost serving as the perfect pilot for any decision-maker who wants to prove that everything that comes before “but” is just empty words.

This goes beyond technology-first approaches currently adopted by many governments. In this post-digital era, technology has become foundational in most parts of society. Estonia, known as one of the most technologically advanced public services, has used advanced technology since the mid-1990s. By removing paper and moving services online, Estonia created eEstonia , where 99.9% of public services are online. The data-based society, digital infrastructure, and trust in digital services allow for a reimagining of how services operate and their value. Though, high-profile public sector failures, such as ​​DWP errors that left over 200,000 pensioners £1.3bn out of pocket , highlight ongoing integration issues.

    "content": "Home Insights Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Case study September 5, 2022 Oman embraces digitalization by completing a fully register-based census Service Data and AI eCensus Seamless Experiences Industry Government Real-Time Economy e-Census and Statistics In today’s ever-changing world, where data-driven decision-making is key, a census is one of the most critical surveys a state conducts. At the end of a tumultuous year of COVID restrictions and lockdowns in 2020, the Sultanate of Oman completed a fully register-based census on their first try. Thus, allowing the country to run a one-click census at any time and react to population changes quickly and efficiently. Government innovation The evolution of the census Throughout time, census data has been used to inform and direct policy. However, how censuses are conducted has changed with the advancement of technology. In 1440, the Incas, who didn’t have a written language, used a system of knots on strings made from llama or alpaca hair to record census data and administer their empire. In 2020, 580 years later, Oman conducted a fully-register-based census with all three registries on their first try. Oman’s method was even highlighted by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) as an international model of shifting from a traditional census to a register-based census. In the past 20 years, Oman has put a strong emphasis on digitalization. As a result, the country’s eGovernment Development Index has risen from 0.3548 (rank 98) in 2003 to 0.7749 (rank 50) in 2020. The one-click census is another excellent example of this digital transformation journey. 1993 Civil register established 2003 National Strategy for Digital Society and eGovernance 2009 National Data Centre (NDC) inaugurated 2010 Oman National Computer Emergency Readiness Team (OCERT) launched 2012 Digital Transformation program commences 2014 Government cloud G-Cloud launched 2016 Invest Easy portal launched 2017 Tax Management System for Corporate Income Tax implemented 2018 e-Justice System “Tawtheeq” launched 2020 First e-Census completed Challenge The transformation of the census in Oman Oman conducted its first census in 1993, with subsequent censuses in 2003 and 2010. The traditional census has two main drains — time and money. It costs a lot to conduct and takes time to get the results. The 2010 census combined door-to-door visits by enumerators and an online questionnaire. In total, close to 6,600 people were involved in the process, with costs ranging from salaries, transportation, and per diems to post-census analysis and publication costs. In addition, much of the data entry and processing was manual, opening it up to errors. For the 2020 census , Oman was forward-thinking and embraced innovation fully. We worked closely with the National Center for Statistics and Information to create a data processing strategy, architecture design and to develop the e-Census project. As a result, the Sultanate became one of a few countries at a global level and the first in the Arab world to conduct a census that relied entirely on data collection through administrative records. The data obtained and the indicators provided by the census are vital for enhancing Oman Vision 2040 and have important implications for the developmental planning of all sectors of the Sultanate. – Taavi Einaste, CEO, Middle East and Africa Oman’s successful fully register-based census is a huge step toward real-time decision making, which on a national level can lead to better efficiency, quicker policy-making, and happier people. Solution A fully register-based census This approach takes advantage of the input received from various administrative registers. The data is cross-referenced using advanced extract, load, and transformation practices to obtain the necessary information for census readiness. A key goal of the e-Census 2020 project was to implement population, housing, and establishment hubs that update in near real-time — as soon as an entry is made into the administrative registers. Together with the ambitious team at National Center of Statistical Information (NCSI), Nortal successfully established common data exchange standards, which were used by 24 administrative registers that provided data for the census. Using state-of-the-art technology, the e-Census 2020 solution can ingest millions of records from various administrative registers. Statistical classifications are applied using the metadata, followed by technical and logical data validation checks. The statistical authority in Oman works with aggregated data, therefore maintaining the privacy of its citizens and residents. Eventually, census methodology is applied to the data from registers, and geospatial data is processed to support the census. The output is then disseminated through the e-Census online portal. The entire process is fully automated, enabling Oman to execute an on-demand census at any time. 4.5m People counted 95% Data quality 100m+ Records processed Impact First in the Arab world On December 14, 2020, His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik endorsed the results of the e-Census 2020 of Population, Residences and Establishments, which showed that as of December 12, 2020 the population of the Sultanate stood at 4,471,148. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19, the e-Census 2020 was executed on schedule. Oman became the first nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers in a single census on the first attempt. The United Nations Population Fund describes Oman’s census as a global model for the transition from traditional censuses based on field surveys to censuses based on national administrative records. Oman’s fully register-based census boasted data quality of 95%, with more than 100 million records processed. It has been theorized that about 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census, most of which resulted from having just 74 employees working on the census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. Oman became the first country in the GCC to achieve a 100% register-based census in 2020. 1st 1st nation in the Arab world to count successfully and simultaneously all three of its main registers on the first attempt. 23m About 23 million USD was saved by switching to a fully-register-based census. 74 Only 74 employees worked on the 2020 census compared to 6,000+ staff in 2010. The foundation of a proactive government The e-Census is only the first step. It provides policymakers with crucial information for understanding population changes in different regions and categories to be able to plan for the future. Furthermore, it allows the government to communicate with its citizens proactively, based on their needs, preferences, and life events, such as marriage or birth of a child. For example, birth data allows the government to automatically share information about benefits and other helpful information for new parents. Or in relation to higher education, the government can use data about university students and their specializations to plan jobs and other employment enablement plans for the youth entering the job market. Designing and implementing proactive services allows the government to increase engagement and offer excellent value to its citizens and residents. – Tomy Bosco, Business Area Director It has been a real privilege to work on this project with the NCSI and the Sultanate of Oman. I think Oman is a true global trailblazer – demonstrating how technology can accelerate and enable public services. Transforming governments, transforming societies The right digital tools applied properly can dramatically transform citizen-government interaction, changing the way societies work. A digitally-enabled government is citizen-centric, proactively meeting needs when it comes to social security and taxation. It literally changes the way citizens interact with and experience their government.

    "content": "Tag list Government Strategy and Transformation Government Transformation Responsible businesses need to demonstrate by example exactly how digitalization can lend a helping hand, says Harri Koponen, Chief Commercial Officer of Nortal Group in an interview to Finnish radio channel Business FM. “Responsibility is everything,” says Harri Koponen , Chief Commercial Officer of Nortal Group, when speaking about the principles of sustainability in international business. “Indeed, we have to bear in mind where and how to invest and truly know who our partners are. To make sure everything we do has a positive spin on our lives. To know how raw materials are sourced, how recycling is arranged and to be mindful of energy consumption. So the objective is to act responsibly and to act as good corporate citizens.” According to Koponen, responsible operations are facilitated by digitalization , which creates transparency from production to logistics to delivery, and to the safe use of the product or service. Responsibility principles are widely embraced in Finland, especially among pension funds and private investors. In Koponen’s view, accountability is a popular and prevalent topic in that country, and the next level is to offer transparent, real-life examples demonstrating how an organization is tangibly adhering to the principles of responsibility. “At Nortal, we have completed a program showcasing how the entire operational chain works, naming our suppliers, etc.,” says Koponen. In Finland, sustainability is an important issue since Finns are very environmentally focused and understand the high price to be paid by squandering it. “I haven’t met a single Finn who doesn’t think ecologically. Every person has a sense of devotion to the environment,” believes Koponen. With the help of digitalization, act responsibly and create a positive twist Koponen also believes that trust is Finland’s trump card, because internationally, Finns have the reputation of being trustworthy, upstanding and straightforward. “There is a clear understanding that Finns are taking care of business , keeping promises and paying back debts — if there are any. All in all, things will get done as promised in Finland, and this is globally valued.” Digitalization as a guiding light When speaking of digitalization, first, Koponen sees startups as relevant players in the field. “We should think about how to take care of startups — if they should be taxed immediately or only once they make a profit, or do we treat them as they do in Estonia where young companies can keep their profits for the first five to ten years. In that time, startups can strengthen their balance sheets and invest in themselves, which means new jobs, and the state can collect its tax income from labor duties,” says Koponen. Secondly, on the R&D side, he believes product development research requires more attention and increased collaboration between universities and companies. Koponen highlights Finland’s strengths in digitalization, as the country has a lot of people and experience in the field and education plays a crucial role. “For a long time, Finland has maintained a digitalization agenda, with entrepreneurs who have created Linux SSH. Still, education needs more focus because it is the foundation of strong digitalization.” Koponen also sees that a few things can be learned from Estonia. “In a way, Estonia abandoned everything traditional and moved ahead with a new approach and new technologies. The systems are working seamlessly and this makes for happy and satisfied end-users. For example, you can obtain Estonian digital citizenship and then operate within the country without a physical presence.” Digitalization’s biggest upside is that it is not done for digitalization’s sake; rather, it’s for supporting business decisions with the help of IT systems. “I would speak of support intelligence, engaging computers in order to make smarter and quicker decisions. Literally, if something looks like a dark forest, digitalization can show us illuminated spots and quickly orient us. This is why new services have emerged — like Uber and AirBnB — disrupting traditional, hierarchical organizations.” Related content News 10.01.2024 Seamless Experiences Government Citizen-Centric Personalized Digital Government Strategy and Transformation Government Transformation Priit Alamäe: Challenging the “but” in digitalization The outcome of government digitalization is not digital processes but increased transparency, reduced corruption, economic advancement, and public approval.

Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Data and AI Every Factory Lead and Head of Production understands the frustration of receiving yesterday’s production report, only to discover problems that are already too late to address. When you oversee industrial operations, the pressure is constant: profit margins are narrow, equipment must operate continuously, and safety cannot be compromised.

Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) are today’s hammer that makes every problem look like a nail. While GenAI can write text, create images, and even answer questions like a human, it is not a complete solution for the challenges faced on your factory floor. Your ultimate game-changer lies elsewhere: in real-time data combined with AI-driven analytics, including Machine Learning (ML), and – yes – in some cases, GenAI as well. Technologies that enable the effective use of real-time data have been available for quite a while. However, in our experience, many Finnish factories, for example, still rely on batch data. This approach means that analyses and decisions are based on what happened yesterday, rather than on what’s happening now – let alone what’s going to happen later today. Too often, our customers try to navigate their operations by looking only at yesterday’s trends. What’s hitting your bottom line aren’t IT issues, but business bottlenecks Siloed, inaccessible data is often viewed as an IT problem. We have seen that this perception frequently stems from the fact that no single business area considers the challenges posed by data delays significant enough to warrant action. Despite this, the demand for real-time data is growing, particularly for production-related use cases that can drive margins. This trend is due to changes in the marketplace and the rise of low-threshold AI technologies, including, but not limited to, LLMs. For example, in fall 2025, Nordic electricity markets moved to 15-minute settlement periods , resulting in 96 price intervals per day instead of the previous 24. This change means that electricity prices now fluctuate four times an hour. This shift aims to improve flexibility and better integrate renewable energy sources. However, it also means that what was previously considered “good enough” planning is no longer adequate. Nortal recently worked with our customer Stora Enso on a project to accurately forecast energy usage in the current, highly volatile 15-minute market. This kind of real-time data and reliable forecasts of factories’ energy consumption would allow any industrial player to identify energy-intensive parts of its processes, optimize them, and balance demand, supply, and prices. Using outdated, inaccurate consumption forecasting, on the other hand, means industrial companies will either pay a premium for last-minute energy or lose money by selling their excess power at a discount. Purchasing energy, a day in advance is the most cost-effective option. Companies that effectively utilize real-time data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast their 24-hour energy consumption can save significantly. With these capabilities, industrial players can optimize both their own energy usage and the energy they purchase. Another silent margin killer in industrial settings is unplanned downtime. A single broken machine can paralyze an entire production line. For example. at one of Nortal’s manufacturing customers, a failure in a processing line could result in thousands of kilos of food spoiling before anyone even has a chance to react. This not only results in wasted products but also incurs lost revenue and dissatisfied customers, which can have a ripple effect across the supply chain. Companies could save millions by gaining real-time visibility into what is happening at their manufacturing sites. Even better, they could utilize that data and AI to predict equipment health before a failure occurs. Real-time analytics can ensure that you have the right people in the right places at the right time, while also prioritizing their health. Picture this: a packaging line unexpectedly slows down. Do you have the flexibility to redeploy staff from another area? With real-time visibility into workforce allocation, you can achieve significant savings by facilitating more effective employee rotation. From a workplace health perspective, real-time data keeps you informed about such issues as unauthorized activity in restricted areas, compliance with safety gear rules in your factories, and potential collision risks when people and machines, like autonomous forklifts, operate on the same premises. The challenges described above aren’t just IT headaches; they represent business bottlenecks that can impact margins, efficiency, and competitiveness. The longer these issues go unaddressed, the greater the cost to your organization. Discover how we can help you leverage Microsoft Fabric for real-time, compliant data See how we unify your data with Microsoft Fabric From hindsight and scribbles to foresight and confidence Instead of focusing on today’s challenges, imagine having a clear, real-time view of your factory. You know what’s happening right now (not just yesterday), and you could predict what will happen in the next hour or even tomorrow. This capability allows you to adjust production before problems escalate, optimize energy costs by forecasting consumption, proactively add staff at critical production lines or cells, and prevent costly breakdowns or accidents on the shop floor by identifying anomalies early. Here lies the magic of real-time data. It serves as the foundation for more intelligent technology use cases. AI, whether through machine learning or advanced models like generative AI, transforms that data into actionable insights and foresight. So, how does GenAI fit in? It is indeed powerful, yes, but it’s not a silver bullet. It can serve as an intuitive user interface for various tools, and one of its greatest promises in manufacturing lies in its ability to integrate structured and unstructured data. GenAI can transform messy, handwritten maintenance logs from past decades into clear, actionable instructions. This would reduce your factories’ reliance on experienced workers who may be the only ones to remember how to resolve disruptions on the manufacturing line or who have jotted down notes in a pile of notebooks. Once you have historical data organized effectively, and make real-time data, structured machinery data, and analysis tools available, you will create a dynamic digital assistant for your maintenance workers. The tool adapts to on-site events, enhances maintenance and troubleshooting efforts, and significantly increases the onboarding efficiency for new employees. At Nortal, we understand manufacturing and data. We’ve developed real-time data and AI solutions for companies like Outokumpu , a large forest industry company and Valmet . One key lesson we have learned is that investments in data often stall while waiting for that one “killer use case” that promises to transform everything. GenAI could be that game changer for your business, or it might be other forms of AI analytics like Machine Learning. However, we challenge you to consider a different approach: what if you invest in an AI-ready data foundation today rather than waiting for the ideal “killer application” to emerge? By establishing scalable, real-time data capabilities now, you can accelerate innovation, run rapid experiments, and harness the value of novel AI solutions ahead of your competitors.

    "content": "Case study December 18, 2025 Staying steady in a volatile market: AI-powered forecasting at Stora Enso In industries such as renewable packaging, biomaterials, and wood products, planning has become a balancing act. Service Data and AI Technology and Engineering Industry Industry Manufacturing Energy and Resources Fluctuating energy prices, rapidly changing demand, and production challenging production decisions make accurate planning difficult. Manual forecasting often falls short, leading to gaps between projections and customers’ actual needs. Do unpredictable swings always signal uncertainty? AI-powered forecasting leverages real-time data and predictive insights to transform complexity into clarity, enabling Stora Enso to plan smarter, respond faster, and stay ahead rather than catch up. Stora Enso is a leading provider of renewable products in packaging, biomaterials, and wood construction, as well as one of the largest private forest owners in the world. Guided by its purpose, “Do good for people and the planet, and replace non-renewable materials with renewable products,” Stora Enso continually seeks to enhance operational efficiency and minimize its environmental footprint. Accurate forecasting enables better business A few years ago, Stora Enso recognized that accurate energy consumption forecasts are fundamental to one of the company’s core business priorities: optimizing value in a circular bioeconomy. “Most Stora Enso sites produce packaging and biomaterials, which requires electricity and steam for drying,” explains Christopher Tonk, Digital Solution Advisor at Stora Enso. The company produces parts of its operational energy needs in-house and purchases the remaining from the market. This requires continual balancing of demand, supply, and prices, especially given the heightened volatility in energy markets since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. As Tonk explains: “We want to be able to accurately forecast the demand of steam and electricity, especially for the next 24 hours. Without the ability to forecast in near-real time, we could not react immediately to, e.g., planned and unplanned shutdowns. By improving and automating our forecasting, we would enable those near-real-time predictions.” A primary objective in developing energy consumption forecasting was to reduce Stora Enso’s energy costs. Additionally, the goal was to support the company’s sustainability agenda by decreasing energy use per ton of products sold. “Supporting our sustainability goals is very important for Stora Enso as a whole,” Tonk emphasizes. Co-creation brought together the process, the tool, and the people Stora Enso and Nortal co-created an energy demand forecasting solution. The solution was piloted in one of Stora Enso’s Finnish mills and consists of three elements: Process: The existing workflow was improved and optimized by implementing AI-based forecasting and integrating it seamlessly. Tool: A productized, AI-powered Energy Demand Prediction Tool (EDPT), running in the Azure cloud, is integrated into Stora Enso’s Energy Management System. Forecast visualizations are also available in Power BI. People: From the outset, the solution was designed to align with existing practices and enhance mill operators’ daily work with minimal disruption. To train the AI models, the system is provided with 1–2 years of historical process data. The training dataset also includes shutdown and production plans, as well as freshwater temperatures. Weather conditions and forecasts are also essential, given Finland’s significant seasonal temperature variations. Leveraging this intelligence, the solution automatically estimates the amount of electricity and steam required to produce a given product. Invisible technology with powerful impact “We have achieved excellent results under normal, steady operations,” explains Christopher Tonk, and continues: “With such accuracy, the solution will be an important lever in enabling us further to optimize our power plant and energy market operations.” Tonk also envisions additional impactful outcomes: “Now that we have that information, insights, and forecasts available, we are investigating other opportunities as well. Maybe we can find entirely new revenue streams from that intel.” Seamlessly integrated into existing processes and tools, the new, more accurate forecasting solution runs in the background, causing minimal disruption to site experts’ daily work. It is almost invisible – just as the best technology should be. Christopher Tonk, Digital Solution Advisor at Stora Enso “We have achieved excellent results under normal, steady operations.

    "content": "Case study December 17, 2025 Fueling transformation: St1’s journey to a scalable, AI-ready data landscape As a Nordic energy transition company St1 accelerated its shift toward CO₂-aware energy and entirely new lines of business, its legacy data platform became a growing bottleneck - it was too slow and rigid to support real-time insights and AI-driven innovation. We helped St1 rebuild its data foundation into a scalable, domain-driven platform that now powers real-time decision-making and unlocks new business use cases, positioning the company for an AI-ready future. Service Data and AI Industry Energy and Resources St1’s vision is to be the leading producer and seller of CO2-aware energy. The company believes in transparency, fairness, sustainability, and equal opportunities. Over the past decade, St1 has invested boldly in renewable energy projects, including geothermal wells research in Otaniemi, wind power, and renewable fuels. Johannes Heikkinen , Head of Architecture, Data & Technology at St1, describes the strategic change St1 is embracing: “Our focus has moved from efficient operations of the traditional oil products’ value chain to building three entirely new value chains. These include hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biogas, and electric vehicle charging.” With this business transformation ongoing, the Business Technology unit at St1 has also moved beyond its traditional IT role to become a partner and enabler of core business processes. To align technology and data with the new value chains’ needs, St1 has adopted a business-domain-driven model for IT development and delivery. Building the foundation: partnership and platform A few years ago, St1 recognized that its existing data platform, along with its operating and governance models, were hindering the business transformation. While the platform continued to function, it had become increasingly slow and expensive to scale. Several components were reaching the end of life and implementing new use cases - such as those requiring real-time data and APIs - provided challenging. St1’s new direction required a modern platform designed to handle rapidly growing data demands and ensure AI readiness, all underpinned by a scalable governance and operating model fit for the future. St1 expanded its existing partnership with Nortal to include data management, appointing Ergin Tuganay as Lead Data Architect to help renew its data foundation. “From the start, our approach hasn't been about renewing only technology to match future needs, but to build an operating and governance model that scales with growing business needs. Also, in the era of ever-accelerating technical evolution and AI, both the platform operating and governance models are designed to support flexibility and future evolution.” Working together, St1 and Nortal designed and built the Data & Analytics Platform (DAAP). Their goal was to iteratively develop a platform, along with supporting governance and operating models. that would adapt and scale to the diverse needs of different domains and value streams, both now and in the future. The platform and its governance framework draw inspiration from data mesh principles, which have been pragmatically tailored to meet St1’s unique requirements rather than applied in a purely theoretical way. Technically, the platform is built on Microsoft Azure, Databricks, and Power BI. It supports both batch and streaming data, handles structured and unstructured formats, and is ready for AI-driven use cases. Ergin Tuganay, Head of Data & AI at Nortal Finland “From the start, our approach hasn't been about renewing only technology to match future needs, but to build an operating and governance model that scales with growing business needs.\" From data to business value \"While part of the work is migrating existing data warehouse assets into the new platform, the new platform has also enabled St1 to realize valuable data use cases that were not possible before. For example, we can now identify high-value and at-risk customers in real time. This allows us to track segment changes and empowers our marketing and sales teams to personalize communication and offers,” explains Johannes Heikkinen from St1. With the new data platform in place, St1’s customer service can also serve customers based on real-time transaction data. “The new solution for the customer support service significantly improves transparency and speeds up problem resolution.” Nortal’s Tuganay notes and continues: “I see the most interesting opportunities for St1’s future in the platform’s abilities to provide data as a product for various kinds of use cases from reporting and business intelligence, digital applications, or advanced analytics and AI-powered applications.” Right balance between control and empowerment St1 and Nortal invested significant effort into creating a clear, well-defined governance and operating model for the new data platform. For example, the teams, roles, documentation, and even role-specific onboarding and training plans were pre-defined. Heikkinen notes that, at earlier stages of the project, this level of thoroughness was even somewhat overwhelming. However, it has recently started to pay off: “Now that the platform foundation is in place, and the organizational change is slowly catching up, we really see the value of our well-thought-out governance model.” One of the key learnings from the project, according to Heikkinen, was the important of change management. “Change management would always deserve more focus than it gets. We had the correct approach, coming from both ends: from data management and platform, and from leadership and business needs.” However, as Heikkinen notes, it has required substantial work and several incremental steps to bring these two together. Now, St1 is beginning to see its business domains recognize the platform's value through real business cases. They are now actively ideating use cases for the new data platform and the real-time insights it generates, and the AI capabilities it unlocks. Both Heikkinen and Tuganay emphasize that, since different business domains vary in their maturity, support cannot be “one size fits all.” Instead, multiple modes of enablement are necessary to address a range of needs. Johannes Heikkinen, Head of Architecture, Data and Technology, St1 “From the start, Nortal has differentiated itself by not just selling us a bunch of developers but offering a team that understands the relevant business context and processes.\" When value leads, sales will follow Since 2021, St1 and Nortal have worked as one team with shared goals. Johannes Heikkinen sums up the partnership: “From the start, Nortal has differentiated itself by not just selling us a bunch of developers but offering a team that understands the relevant business context and processes. They have also convinced us with the professional approach of not being too eager to sell.” He then smiles and concludes: “At the end, the best sales pitch is when the partner produces something that brings real business value.” Listen and watch the full story Learn more about this project by watching the keynote by Johannes and Ergin, recorded at Nortal’s Partner Event during Helsinki Data Week 2025.

    "title": "Transforming steel slab handling for greater efficiency",
    "content": "Case study December 3, 2025 Transforming steel slab handling for greater efficiency SSAB partnered with Nortal to design a digital slab handling system that improves efficiency and supports smarter, safer decision-making at the Raahe mill. Service Experience and Design Industry Manufacturing Industry SSAB is a global leader in high-strength steels and related services, with a bold goal to offer fossil-free steel by 2026 and largely eliminate carbon emissions in its operations by 2030, taking significant steps towards sustainability. As part of this commitment, SSAB initiated a project to modernize its slab handling system at the Raahe steel mill. The goal has been to replace an outdated, manually driven system with a digital solution that optimizes workflows and prioritizes the needs of its users. The research, design, and prototyping phases of this project have been successfully completed, setting the stage for implementation in the next phase, where the full benefits of a user-centric approach will be realized. Understanding the n eed for c hange SSAB's existing slab handling system has served its purpose for decades However, it relies on multiple software tools and heavily manual processes, such as radio and phone communication, to coordinate tasks. This approach no longer meets the demands of today’s modern steel production environment, where faster response times and more flexible and scalable workflows are essential. To address this, SSAB, a long-term partner of Nortal, collaborated with Nortal to design a modern slab handling system tailored to today’s demands. From the beginning, the project prioritized a design-driven approach, ensuring that the solution goes beyond technical functionality to genuinely enhance the worker experience. A d esign- d riven, u ser- c entric a pproach To build a strong foundation, our team conducted an extensive user research, engaging directly with SSAB employees who interact with the slab handling process daily. Our team identified several areas where user-centric improvements could drive significant value. The research phase provided crucial insights into their daily routines, the obstacles they face, and what they need to work more effectively. Out of the 100 workers involved in slab operations, around 60 took part in interviews. Their input helped us understand how slabs are handled, from movement to processing and storage. Taneli Kulo, Senior Service Designer, Nortal “This project stands out in my 30-year career as one where design and user experience have truly taken centre stage. While I’ve seen the value of user-centricity in other projects, this one has been exceptional in its deep focus on the service journey, not just technical details.” The research phase was followed by concept development and prototyping. During this phase, we identified key process disruptions - such as equipment malfunctions, unclear markings, and communication challenges - that were slowing down inspectors and maintenance staff while increasing workload and safety risks. To address these challenges, we designed an interface concept that offers real-time guidance for slab handling, with an emphasis on clear communication and ease of use, as well as the ability to adjust to different situations. Instead of directly controlling machinery, the system serves as a decision-support tool, offering actionable recommendations based on real-time data. This design enables workers to make faster, smarter decisions while reducing reliance on inefficient manual communication. By shifting from a technology-first mindset to a user-first approach, SSAB ensures the system is built around actual user needs. We created a strong prototype that will significantly enhance workflow efficiency once implemented. The system will simplify daily tasks, reduce friction in operations, and better support the people who handle slabs as part of their routine. Next s teps : turning d esign into r eality With the research, design, and prototyping phase now completed, the next critical step is system implementation. This is where the full impact of the user-centric approach will be realized. When fully implemented, the system is expected to: Reduce training time for new employees by providing an intuitive, easy-to-use interface Minimize errors by delivering relevant, real-time data to workers Enable faster decision-making with clear, actionable recommendations Improve overall production efficiency by streamlining workflows Reduce unnecessary movement around the factory floor, enhancing safety Ensure adaptability to integrate with future technologies and evolving production needs By prioritizing user experience, collaboration, and real-time data utilization, SSAB is taking a forward-thinking approach to industrial digitalization. This initiative marks real progress in improving how slab handling operations are carried out, with a clear focus on long-term adaptability and performance. Laying the foundation for a smarter future The work done during the research, design, and prototyping phases has laid a solid roadmap for implementation, helping to ensure that the system rollout will support both user needs and production targets. SSAB's commitment to user-centricity in this project sets a new standard or how digital solutions can enhance industrial operations. As the implementation phase beings, the impact of this approach will soon be visible in how slab handling is carried out, bringing meaningful improvements to both safety and performance.

    "content": "Case study December 2, 2025 Application automatically allocates consultation rooms at TYKS Compass Hospital and in the Salo unit – reducing the need for space by up to 30–40% Service Healthcare Industry Healthcare Digital Transformation In the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland’s new psychiatric hospital at TYKS Compass Hospital, a multi-space environment model was introduced in autumn 2024. Under this model, healthcare professionals do not have dedicated consultation rooms; instead, rooms are allocated based on the varying needs of outpatient care. This approach is based on a new method of space utilization introduced in spring 2023 at the psychiatric unit of the Salo IOT Campus. This model has proven effective in promoting more efficient use of facilities. Empty rooms, rising costs One common issue that leads to rooms standing empty in hospital facilities occurs when an employee works in a unit only a few days a week and has a personal room that remains unused by other staff members and patients, but it stands vacant instead. More efficient use of space helps prevent oversized premises and their costs. This approach ensures optimal space utilization for patient care, improves space efficiency, and leads to overall cost savings. Marko Muukka, Project Manager for Psychiatry at TYKS “This is a truly extensive change in our ways of working and in our culture. I would compare it to replacing a 1970s car with an electric vehicle. Moving to a multi-space environment model is not only a general development trend in Finland, but we are also seeing the same phenomenon more broadly across the Nordic countries and even internationally. For it to work, it needs a user-centric application for managing space resources, built around actual space requirements and designed to make it easy to reserve rooms.” The Space Resource Management Application To maximize the efficiency of the new facilities and ensure that basic healthcare service processes function seamlessly under the latest model, the Compass Hospital and the psychiatric unit in Salo chose to adopt Nortal’s Space Resource Management application, a solution developed and tailored specifically for the social and healthcare sectors. Healthcare professionals can submit a booking request through the Space Resource Management application. The system then prioritizes the requests and assigns rooms accordingly. Rooms are allocated to clinical staff based on predefined criteria that consider patient care needs. The reserved space is displayed in both the users’ calendars and in the room-booking application. Marko Muukka, Project Manager for Psychiatry at TYKS “Our cooperation with Nortal has been smooth, and based on the experiences in Salo, it was well justified to introduce the Space Resource Management application at Compass Hospital as well. According to user feedback, the application’s technical use is very easy. Staff in the units can easily see their room bookings and find the most suitable consultation room. Without a functioning application, managing the hospital’s facilities would be impossible.” Since the rollout, the application’s room bookings have been monitored in line with the needs and objectives of clinical work. Based on user experience, the automatic room allocation has been further refined to better meet the specific needs of the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland’s psychiatric units. Mikko Lehto, VP of Government and Health at Nortal “In the traditional model, where healthcare professionals have their own designated rooms, the utilization rate and efficiency of care facilities have been at a low level. At TYKS Compass Hospital and the psychiatric unit in Salo, there are in total just over 100 consultation rooms and other function-critical spaces, and their use has been optimized for approximately 180 employees.” Unlock the full potential of your hospital’s consultation rooms with The Space Resource Management Solution, tailored for optimal efficiency and seamless workflow.

CRR III/CRD VI Banking Package Built on the Basel III framework, the CRR III/CRD VI Banking Package is one of the most extensive regulations to come into force in 2025. It aims to improve banks’ financial stability and resilience by updating the EU's capital requirements, risk assessments, and reporting obligations. Meeting the new mandates won’t be easy; for example, CRR III requires banks to evaluate the quality of property collateral, its legal enforceability, and careful valuation, going beyond standard methods to ensure they have enough resources to manage financial stress. If you're gearing up for these changes, AI-enhanced collateral management systems and automated valuation models provide priceless support. They effectively track, manage, and optimise the assets pledged as collateral to ensure maximum value and protection against loans or credit risks. To do that reliably and ensure compliance with CRR III's strict provisions, modern collateral management systems use real-time data to evaluate a bank’s assets and provide an up-to-date view of the bank's financial condition and risks. In addition, automated valuation models , especially those using machine learning, offer accurate, real-time property valuations while reducing human error. They can instantly analyse massive datasets to deliver precise valuations, consistent with previous property appraisals. Instead of using unreliable spreadsheet-based processes and fragmented workflows, these models allow bank staff to track every asset with just a few clicks. To tap into these and other innovations that will make compliance with CRR III/CRD VI requirements less complex, you need support from professionals proficient at handling machine learning models. For example, a data science expert adept in Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and machine learning technologies and algorithms who led an AI-driven project for one of our fintech clients . The right mix of skills and experience, along with the strategic hiring of a dedicated team, will facilitate the development of solutions that ensure compliance with the new banking package. Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”) With DORA’s arrival in January 2025, the EU is raising the bar for IT resilience across financial institutions. Now, systems will be required to withstand, adapt, and recover from disruptions seamlessly. DORA focuses on cybersecurity and data protection. These standards require real-time threat intelligence, swift incident response, and strong encryption measures to keep data safe and confidential. This also extends to the entire supply chain. Financial firms must ensure their providers adhere to the new procedures, including those for incident reporting, exit strategies, and contractual obligations around resilience. As cybercrime risks continue to rise, the finance sector is increasing its investment in regulatory technology (regtech) to ensure stronger regulatory oversight. In 2021, the global investment in regtech solutions reached €11 billion. These tools reduce administrative loads and minimise potential errors by automating compliance tracking and simplifying reporting. They can also apply analytical capabilities to detect and mitigate risks by analysing past patterns and enhancing those analyses with incoming, real-time information. Another effective tool that can effectively help financial organisations meet DORA requirements and keep their asset safe is digital twins . By creating virtual replicas of their systems, banks and fintechs can simulate outages and cyberattacks and assess how their infrastructure performs without compromising the integrity or confidentiality of data. Powered by machine learning algorithms, this technology analyses thousands of potential risk scenarios and provides insights for better risk assessment. Again, as crucial as regtech and digital twins may be for DORA compliance, they demand highly specialised skills. These can be secured fast with augmented teams providing essential cybersecurity, system automation, and data processing expertise. Payment Services Directive (PSD3) PSD3 tightens customer authentication and information-sharing standards, encouraging secure data exchange between banks, payment providers, and third-party services. The goal is to make financial services safer and more accessible for EU Member States. To meet these standards, fintech companies continue to adopt open banking APIs . These allow them to instantly and securely share data across platforms, creating a seamless, interconnected financial ecosystem with other financial providers, regulatory bodies, data aggregators, investment and e-commerce platforms, and so on. Secure financial exchanges are also enabled by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) , including blockchain, currently in use by 22% of EU banks , with 60% more exploring their capabilities. Technology can support compliance with PSD3 regulations in many ways. First, by making tracing payment flows easier, as all transactions are verified across multiple nodes. By offering an immutable record of all transactions and making them easy to access and monitor, DLT allows for easy verification of all dealings and precludes tampering with records. Blockchain and its counterparts also subscribe to PSD3’s reporting and real-time monitoring standards, offering on-demand insight into current transactions. To adequately respond to PSD3’s push to improve customer identification and reduce payment fraud, finance institutions are deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA) and AI-powered Know Your Customer (KYC) solutions . Automated KYC models replace manually reviewing passports and IDs and cross-referencing details against the government and third-party databases with real-time, immediate identity checks. This helps eliminate human error and improves the onboarding experience for customers, who can securely manage their finances from their phone screens. The tools to meet requirements mandated by PSD3 are there, but someone needs to integrate them into a complex financial tech stack. Finding tech professionals skilled in industry-specific technologies and regulatory compliance can be challenging, but we can support you. Through staff augmentation, we quickly place API experts, data analysts, and AI developers into your team, shortening your path to secure, scalable compliance with no upfront fees or risks involved. EBA guidelines on the management of ESG risks The European Banking Authority’s guidelines on managing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks call for financial institutions to integrate ESG factors into their strategic and operational decisions. These guidelines will press your business to rigorously monitor and report ESG exposures and impacts. So, where do you start? A few essential technologies can streamline your ESG journey, such as risk management platforms, sustainability assessment tools, and environmental monitoring systems . These solutions – each individually and together – help evaluate your organisation’s environmental, social, and economic impacts by tracking and analysing vast data. This can include energy use, waste generation, and carbon emissions. The potential of ESG tools spans beyond measuring things and tracking their compliance against the imposed thresholds. Enhanced with predictive models, they can deliver actionable insights that help companies forecast environmental impacts, identify non-compliance, and predict financial risks. Altogether, this leads to a better alignment of business strategy with sustainability goals and regulations. On the downside, integrating these vital yet advanced systems often requires niche expertise in data science, environmental analytics, and regulatory standards. These skills typically fall outside the core experience of a traditional finance team. And even if you already have them in place, a proper setup and data strategy are necessary to ensure ROI and compliance. Meanwhile, 82% of banks globally lack the quality data to integrate ESG, and another 75% lack the right talent to do so. At Nortal, we can quickly bridge these gaps for you with specialists in data science, environmental analytics, and regulatory standards. Our network of experts can help your team turn ESG data into actionable insights, ensuring compliance and impact. Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) Checks The Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) is set to become the EU’s central authority for anti-money laundering (AML), bringing stricter, harmonised measures to financial institutions across member states. This agency will close regulatory loopholes, unify AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) practices, and streamline compliance across borders. It is about to impact how your organisation manages and monitors financial transactions. Compliance with AMLA will demand advanced tools like transaction monitoring systems, screening solutions, and risk assessment platforms . Transaction monitoring systems detect suspicious activity in real-time while screening solutions to cross-check customer data against global watchlists. With global AML technology spending projected to reach $51.7 billion by 2028 , industry leaders like Deutsche Bank are already enhancing their AML infrastructure (likely to protect themselves from incurring hefty multi-million dollar fines from the Financial Conduct Authority due to past AML failures ). But the task, again, is not easy. Building a strong AMLA compliance infrastructure involves a mix of languages and frameworks (including Python for AI and ML programming and R for statistical analyses and predictive analytics) and industry-specific algorithms for screening, classifying and assessing transactions. And the challenge goes beyond technology. It’s also about securing the right expertise to maintain compliance as standards evolve. Building in-house teams with AML, data analytics, and compliance skills is time-intensive and costly, especially for fintechs aiming to scale. In contrast, our augmented teams offer immediate access to tech specialists with experience in the financial sector. They ensure that systems are tailored to meet AMLA’s stringent requirements, while their flexibility helps institutions stay ahead of evolving regulatory expectations. New fintech-specific regulations shaping compliance in 2026 While core banking and financial services regulations continue to evolve, fintechs are facing an additional layer of regulatory change driven by the way digital financial products are built and operated. In 2025 and 2026, regulators are placing increasing focus on areas such as artificial intelligence, real-time payments, fraud prevention, and digital identity – all of which sit at the heart of modern fintech platforms. These developments go beyond traditional compliance checklists. They directly affect product architecture, data governance, and operating models, requiring fintechs to adapt not just what they build, but how systems are designed, monitored, and maintained over time . The following regulatory shifts are particularly important for fintech organisations preparing for 2026. The EU AI Act: a turning point for fintech compliance The EU Artificial Intelligence Act introduces an entirely new compliance layer that is particularly significant for fintechs and digitally led financial institutions. While the regulation entered into force in 2024, its impact accelerates through 2025 and becomes fully enforceable for high-risk systems from August 2026 . Many of the AI use cases common in fintech – including credit scoring, loan approval, fraud detection, AML risk profiling, and automated decision-making that affects access to financial services – are explicitly classified as high-risk AI systems under the Act. From 2025, organisations are already required to avoid prohibited AI practices and begin documenting AI systems, their intended use, and training data. Once full obligations apply in 2026, high-risk systems must meet strict requirements around risk management, human oversight, transparency, auditability, and ongoing monitoring. For fintechs, this marks a shift away from treating AI purely as a performance optimisation tool. Compliance now depends on how AI models are built, governed, tested, and maintained over time , often requiring changes to operating models, internal controls, and team capabilities, not just technical adjustments to algorithms. Instant euro payments and verification of payee (VoP) From 2026, new EU rules will require payment service providers to support instant euro credit transfers , available 24/7 and executed within seconds. Alongside this, providers must implement verification of payee (VoP) checks before transactions are completed, allowing customers to confirm that the beneficiary details match the intended recipient. The aim is to reduce misdirected payments and combat fraud, particularly in real-time payment environments. For fintechs, these requirements raise the bar significantly. Supporting instant payments at scale demands highly resilient infrastructure, real-time monitoring, and automated compliance controls that operate without introducing friction or delays. VoP checks must be tightly integrated into payment flows, identity data, and fraud detection systems. Together, these changes place new demands on both system architecture and operational readiness, particularly for fintechs handling high transaction volumes across multiple markets. Digital identity and onboarding: the EU Digital Identity Wallet The rollout of the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) represents another major shift for fintech compliance and customer onboarding. Under the revised eIDAS framework, EU Member States must make at least one digital identity wallet available by late 2026. Regulated private-sector services – including banks and fintechs – will be expected to accept wallet-based authentication for use cases requiring strong identity verification in the years that follow. For fintechs, this will reshape KYC, onboarding, and authentication processes. Identity verification flows will need to support new standards for credential exchange, user consent, and interoperability across borders. While the wallet promises improved security and user experience, integrating it into existing systems will require updates to identity APIs, compliance workflows, and data governance practices. As with other regulatory changes, the challenge is not only technical integration, but ensuring teams are equipped to operate and maintain compliant identity systems as standards evolve. How augmented teams support ongoing regulatory compliance The fines imposed by global financial regulators on banking and finance institutions for non-compliance i n the first half of 2025, totalling $1.23bn – a 417% increase on the same period in 2024. And while multi-billion-dollar global institutions like Nordea Bank or William Hill can absorb regulatory fines, smaller financial organisations are at risk. For them, this could mean insolvency, especially if their reputation takes a hit and customers start turning their backs. Augmented finance tech teams may help reduce that risk. They bring a mix of skills and expertise to build solutions that keep you compliant with current and upcoming regulations. Here’s why it’s an option worth considering: Fast access to niche skills Speed is essential for adapting to time-sensitive regulations like AMLA. That means you need your tech experts to start working as soon as possible. With our tried and tested hiring process, you’ll have the best candidates ready to join your team in 4 to 8 weeks. Consistent and reliable staffing Traditional hiring can lead to turnover, disrupting compliance efforts. However, we focus on finding talent who match your team’s skill requirements and company culture. Our augmented teams boast a remarkable retention rate of 95.7% , safeguarding the continuity of your business. Expertise in enabler tech Financial compliance today demands an advanced understanding of technologies like AI-powered risk assessment, open banking APIs, RegTech, and digital twins.

    "title": "From locked data to live insights: how the EU Data Act transforms industrial analytics",
    "content": "Article November 17, 2025 by Ergin Tuganay, Head of Data & AI, Nortal Finland From locked data to live insights: how the EU Data Act transforms industrial analytics The EU Data Act changes how industrial IoT data can be accessed and used. Read our article on what this means for your business. Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Data and AI You own the machine. You run the operations. You generate the data . But until now, accessing that data has often meant navigating vendor-controlled ecosystems. The EU Data Act changes that by giv ing you, the machine user, the legal right to access and use your data freely. By unlocking access to machine-generated data, the EU Data Act lays the foundation for real-time analytics, enabling smarter and faster decision-making across industrial operations. Have you ever felt disconnected from the machine data in your own facility? If so, you’re not alone. In many factories and other industrial facilities, machines quietly generate vast amounts of valuable data. However, accessing this data often requires committing to redundant IT ecosystems. Machine vendors typically prefer to transfer data directly to their own cloud, where it’s bundled with dashboards, predictive tools, and other features. These may duplicate your existing cloud solutions or fail to align with your needs and budget. Even if you only need raw signals, you may be required to commit to the full suite and still face limitations in format, speed, or usability. That has changed. On Friday, September 12, 2025, the EU Data Act came into effect , marking a shift in the governance of industrial data. The EU Data Act grants you, as the machine user, the legal right to access and use the data your equipment produces, including historical data. This shift isn’t just a regulatory update; it’s a strategic opportunity to rethink how data supports your industrial operations. In this article, we aim to take a deeper dive into what regulation means for real-time analytics and how to enable end-to-end operational visibility in industry. The topic and what the EU Data Act means for you in general terms was discussed in our first EU Data Act-related article. EU Data Act unlocks industrial IoT data: here’s what it means for you Your general rights under the EU Data Act While our original article explores the general rights in greater depth, we find it essential to revisit them briefly here to ensure this article provides complete context. Access to your data (Chapter II, “Business to consumer and business to business data sharing”) As defined in regulation, in Chapter II , y ou have the right to access the data your machines generate — both raw and pre-processed . Vendors must provide it free of charge, via simple request . The data can be, for example, basic data to build an OEE — or quality monitoring and optimization solutions, such as machine start- and stop signals ; stop re asons and error code s; production and reject counters ; speed, acceleration , and position ing; or temperatures, pressures, flow rates , and other process measurements . Inferred or enriched data (like AI predictions) is not covered. However, vendors can still offer it as a paid service. Historical data may also be included, if it’s retained and technically accessible. If a vendor’s own service uses it, you can reasonably expect access to the same timeframe. Additionally, from September 12, 2026, all new connected products and services must be designed to ensure this data is directly accessible, secure, free, structured, and machine-readable, as also defined in Chapter II. Fair contracts ( Chapter IV “Unfair contractual terms related to data access and use between enterprises”). Fair contracts ( Chapter IV “Unfair contractual terms related to data access and use between enterprises”). Freedom to switch & interoperability (Chapter VI “Switching between data processing services ” and Chapter VIII “ Interoperability”) . Freedom to switch & interoperability (Chapter VI “Switching between data processing services ” and Chapter VIII “ Interoperability”) . Beyond raw data: enabling end-to-end operational visibility in industry By unlocking access to machine-generated data, the EU Data Act lays the foundation for real-time analytics, enabling smarter decision-making across industrial operations. However, while real-time data is often highlighted in discussions about industrial analytics, it’s just one dimension of a much broader opportunity. The real transformation enabled by the EU Data Act lies in the ability to access and unify data across multiple machines and systems, regardless of vendor . In complex industrial environments, such as packaging and palletizing lines in discrete manufacturing industry, a single production line may include a dozen machines from different manufacturers: dosing units, checkweighers, labeling systems, x-ray scanners, vision systems, boxing robots, barcode readers, conveyors, and more. Historically, accessing data from each of these machines has required time-consuming negotiations, custom integrations, and disproportionately expensive machine connectivity licenses. This dynamic is now changing. By granting machine users the legal right to access the data their equipment produces, the EU Data Act enables companies to systematically collect and combine data from all machines into a unified view . This opens the door to more intelligent monitoring, better control, and agile optimization of entire processes, not just individual components. Thus, the Data Act empowers users to move beyond isolated data silos toward holistic, data-driven operations — including real-time analytics. When raw data becomes openly accessible, building modern data platforms becomes significantly easier. And when customers want to analyze or enrich that data, it opens the door to new kinds of digital services that go beyond just offering access and deliver insight and impact. By turning raw machine data into real-time insights and actionable intelligence, these capabilities not only improve operational efficiency but also enable faster, smarter decision-making across the board. For example, at Outokumpu, we helped apply AI to surface defect detection in stainless steel production , enabling real-time quality control. We also supported their energy efficiency management through a modern integration strategy that unlocked new levels of operational insight. Make the most of the Data Act opportunities The EU Data Act signals a fundamental change in the dynamics of industrial data. Instead of locking data behind proprietary walls, it opens the door for machine users to tap into the raw information they need to drive innovation and build competitive advantage with their own data. This shift challenges vendors to rethink their role — not as gatekeepers but as enablers — creating value through services and solutions rather than through control. However, while the regulation sets a strong foundation, it does not guarantee real-time access or define specific latency requirements. Therefore, it’s highly recommended that you, as an industrial buyer, go beyond written regulations and specify data delivery expectations contractually , such as real-time access, access without additional delay, or access with the same delay as the machine vendor’s own data collection capabilities. By including these terms, you can ensure that the data you receive is not only accessible but also timely and actionable, supporting use cases like predictive maintenance, process optimization, and AI-driven insights. Looking ahead, new investments should be made with data access in mind. Procurement contracts should explicitly guarantee access to the minimum operational data required for effective monitoring and optimization. This principle is reinforced by Chapter II, Article 3 of the Data Act, which mandates that all connected products and related services placed on the EU market after September 12, 2026, must be designed to ensure that such data — and its metadata — is easily, securely, and freely accessible to users in a structured, machine-readable format, and, where feasible, directly accessible. Discover how we can help you leverage Microsoft Fabric for real-time, compliant data See how we unify your data with Microsoft Fabric Thus, don’t wait for regulations to do the heavy lifting. Treat data access as a legal checkbox and a strategic levexr for agility and competitiveness. Challenge your suppliers. And most importantly, ensure your future investments align with the ideology of openness and interoperability. Because real-time analytics is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity for operational excellence. It’s essential to ensure that your machine vendors not only comply with the EU Data Act but also provide data access with minimal delays ideally in real-time or at least with the same latency they themselves use. In our next article, we’ll explore why batch-based data is holding industries back and how timely access can unlock new levels of efficiency. The consequences of human error are costly. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report , businesses lose an average of €3.9 million per breach , with phishing and stolen credentials being the top initial attack vectors. Furthermore, 60% of small and medium-sized businesses go out of business within six months of experiencing a cyberattack. Cyber exercising: The cornerstone of cyber resilience Cyber exercises must be integrated into our security strategy to truly strengthen cyber resilience. These structured simulations test an organisation’s readiness against real-world cyber threats. They help teams practice incident response, refine decision-making processes, clarify communications channels, assure roles and responsibilities, test assumptions, hone tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and build confidence in crises. From critical infrastructure to corporate enterprises, cyber exercising equips teams with the practical experience to respond with clarity and speed. Whether defending national infrastructure or safeguarding sensitive customer data, these exercises transform static response plans into living capabilities.

    "content": "Article November 17, 2025 The pros & cons of a nearshore DevOps team in 2026 As DevOps expands to cover automation, security, and cloud-native complexity, many organizations are rethinking how they build and scale DevOps capability. This article explores the benefits and trade-offs of nearshore DevOps teams, helping tech leaders decide when nearshoring makes sense, and what to watch out for as DevOps continues to evolve. Service IT Outsourcing Staff Augmentation Cloud Transformation As we step into 2026, DevOps has evolved far beyond its initial role of bridging development and operations, now incorporating AI-driven predictive analytics and quantum-safe security measures. Today, it is a cornerstone of digital transformation, helping businesses achieve agility, scalability, and continuous innovation. But as organizations adapt to modern demands, the debate over building in-house DevOps teams versus leveraging nearshore or outsourced solutions persists. We’ll explore the pros and cons of nearshore DevOps teams, dive into emerging trends like AI-powered automation and cloud-native strategies, including platform engineering, low-code/no-code integration, and GreenOps for sustainability, and discuss how businesses can make informed decisions when choosing the best approach for their DevOps strategy. DevOps services for businesses in 2026 The core principles of DevOps – rooted in Lean practices and Agile methodologies – remain just as critical today as when they first emerged. However, the landscape of 2026 brings with it new challenges and opportunities. With the rapid adoption of cloud-native technologies, AI-driven solutions, and infrastructure as code (IaC), alongside advancements in edge computing and microservices architectures, businesses are leaning on DevOps more than ever to drive innovation, reliability, and scalability. What modern DevOps services deliver? Modern DevOps is built around breaking down silos and enabling stronger collaboration across development, operations, and security teams. By embedding continuous feedback loops into everyday workflows, teams can move faster, spot issues earlier, and improve quality without slowing delivery. At the same time, CI/CD has evolved into what many now call “continuous everything.” Testing, integration, delivery, and even large-scale deployments are increasingly automated, creating a smoother and more reliable path from code to production and allowing teams to focus on innovation rather than manual processes. Security is no longer treated as a separate phase. In 2026, DevSecOps is a standard part of the software development lifecycle, with security controls built in from the start to identify and address vulnerabilities before they escalate into real risk. Sustainability has also become part of the DevOps conversation. Through GreenOps practices, teams are optimising cloud usage and infrastructure efficiency, reducing waste and lowering carbon footprints across multi-cloud environments. As a result, DevOps has moved far beyond facilitating software deployment. Today’s teams spend a significant share of their time on observability, monitoring, and security, driven by increasing system complexity, AI-driven workloads, and edge integrations. This shift underlines the critical role DevOps now plays in keeping modern IT ecosystems stable, secure, and scalable. Why distinguish DevOps as a service in 2026? In 2026, DevOps as a Service (DaaS) has become a pivotal solution for businesses navigating hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Here’s what modern DaaS providers bring to the table: Cloud-Native Expertise Skilled in tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, DaaS providers simplify the management of containerised workloads. AI and Machine Learning Integration Leveraging AI, modern DevOps teams can optimize pipelines, predict potential failures through AIOps, and enhance incident response with agentic AI that autonomously orchestrates workflows, making processes more efficient and proactive. GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Using Git-based workflows, DaaS ensures infrastructure updates are consistent, traceable, and error-free. DaaS providers incorporate low-code platforms to democratize DevOps, allowing non-technical users to configure workflows while maintaining CI/CD rigor through versioning and automated promotions. Public cloud platforms remain the leading choice for DevOps, but hybrid and multi-cloud strategies are increasingly prevalent. DaaS enables businesses to stay competitive by offering scalable, cloud-native solutions tailored to evolving market needs. Adopting modern DevOps practices – through in-house teams or trusted DaaS providers – will be a key differentiator for organizations aiming to thrive in this rapidly changing environment, especially as regulations push for sustainable IT operations. The benefits of nearshore DevOps teams in 2026 As DevOps takes on broader responsibility for reliability, security, and cloud complexity, more organisations are looking beyond local hiring to scale their capabilities. Nearshore DevOps teams offer a practical way to balance cost, collaboration, and access to specialised skills, without sacrificing quality or control. Below are the key benefits driving nearshore adoption in 2026. Cost efficiency without compromising quality Nearshore DevOps teams remain a cost-effective solution. In 2026, nearshore rates are, on average, 40-50% lower than onshore alternatives, allowing companies to reinvest savings into innovation amid inflationary pressures. Companies can reinvest these savings into innovation, new technologies, and market expansion while still accessing high-quality talent. Real-time collaboration in shared time zones Time zone alignment facilitates seamless communication and collaboration. Nearshore teams can actively participate in Agile sprints, ensure faster issue resolution, and support continuous delivery workflows without delays. Enhanced AI-powered tools, such as intelligent chatbots and unified dashboards, further streamline interactions, with emerging VR/AR applications enabling immersive virtual sprints for distributed teams. Cultural compatibility Proximity often brings cultural similarities, which minimise misunderstandings and promote smoother cooperation. Nearshore partners tend to share business ethics and work practices, an advantage over offshore models. Access to specialized skills With the complexity of cloud-native architectures, AI integration, and edge computing, plus quantum-safe cryptography and low-code platforms, having access to specialized expertise is essential. Nearshore teams are well-versed in managing advanced CI/CD pipelines, distributed systems, and cutting-edge DevOps tools. Ethical and regulatory challenges As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical concerns and regulatory requirements are growing. Organisations must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to ensure algorithmic fairness and comply with data protection laws to avoid reputational risks and legal setbacks. Scalability and adaptability The flexibility to scale teams up or down based on project needs is invaluable in 2026’s fast-paced environment. Nearshore DevOps partners can quickly adapt to evolving requirements, helping businesses maintain a competitive edge. Challenges of nearshore DevOps teams Every situation has its pros and cons. An external DevOps team comes with challenges and is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every business. To make a well-informed choice, consider these potential downsides, particularly as cyber threats evolve with AI and quantum computing risks. Language and communication barriers While less pronounced than with offshore teams, occasional language nuances or communication gaps can arise. Although translation tools have advanced, they cannot always replace human understanding. Data security and compliance DevOps practices involve handling sensitive data. Ensuring compliance with global data protection regulations requires careful vetting of nearshore partners’ security certifications and processes. In 2026, this includes defending against rising AI-powered threats and supply chain attacks, which surged by 156% in 2024 , requiring quantum-safe protocols and automated certificate management. Integration complexities Merging nearshore teams with existing in-house workflows requires thoughtful planning. Misalignment in tools, methodologies, or expectations can create bottlenecks. Hidden costs Travel expenses, additional project management efforts, and regulatory compliance costs can add up, partially offsetting initial savings. Infrastructure dependence Despite improvements in global internet infrastructure, some nearshore locations may still face occasional connectivity issues, disrupting real-time collaboration. Talent retention Amid global tech talent shortages and AI-driven job shifts, retaining skilled nearshore DevOps engineers can be challenging, with burnout from complex toolchains leading to higher churn rates of up to 15% in some regions. New considerations for 2026 The nearshore DevOps model has expanded to meet modern technological demands. Here are the key trends shaping the DevOps landscape in 2026: AI and Machine Learning in nearshore DevOps teams must stay ahead by mastering AI-driven tools for pipeline optimization, anomaly detection via AIOps, and incident response with agentic AI that handles end-to-end automation. Cloud-Native and Edge Computing Proficiency in Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP is now table stakes. Nearshore teams also need expertise in managing edge deployments for latency-sensitive applications, as edge adoption grows to 40% of DevOps teams for latency-sensitive apps.

Below are three sessions that especially stood out for us by delivering high-impact insights into the evolving Microsoft AI ecosystem: 1. “How AI is redefining Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain” Speaker : Georg Glantschnig, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Agentic ERP Applications Glantschnig introduced the concept of “agentic ERP,” where AI-driven agents manage core business processes within Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain Management (F&SCM). He noted the rapid adoption of AI technologies — over 100 million users of large language models within three months — and highlighted that AI agents can outperform human baselines by nearly 87% in specific tasks. A central innovation discussed was Microsoft’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) , a new architectural layer that acts as a translator and gatekeeper for enterprise data. MCP ensures AI agents access the correct records and tools for each task, allowing businesses to safely build custom agents that interact with backend systems. In his demo, the Expense Report Copilot automatically scanned and categorized expenses, demonstrating how AI agents can streamline traditionally manual processes. This session showcased concrete AI advancements in ERP, from MCP (a foundation for building an “autonomous enterprise”) to real-world agent demonstrations, illustrating how AI is transforming finance and supply chain operations. It presented a vision of ERP as an agent-ready platform, where automated routine tasks like accounting or HR administration free humans to do higher-value work. 2. “How AI is redefining Dynamics 365 Customer Experiences” Speaker: Alan Ross, Head of Product, Dynamics 365 Customer Service & Experiences Engineering Ross explored how AI can enhance every touchpoint of the customer journey in Dynamics 365. Recognizing that many organizations struggle with disconnected systems, he outlined Microsoft’s strategy to deliver an integrated, AI-powered customer experience platform to bring together data, communication channels, and intelligence within a unified cloud solution. He introduced the Quality Evaluation Copilot for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, an AI agent that reviews support cases and call transcripts at scale. It evaluates interactions based on empathy, clarity, and resolution effectiveness, generating quality scores and coaching feedback. For instance, it can flag when an agent’s tone lacks empathy or when an issue remains unresolved, and suggest targeted improvements. Ross also highlighted AI-driven telephony integration through Microsoft Teams, featuring the new Voice Copilot that transcribes calls and assists agents in real time. This session demonstrated how AI can elevate customer service quality and consistency. The Quality Evaluation Copilot is a tangible example of copilot technology driving actionable insights that improve both customer satisfaction and agent performance. It also emphasized Microsoft’s end-to-end advantage of its combined Dynamics, Teams, and AI, showing how a unified platform reduces complexity and accelerates innovation in customer experience management. 3. “Copilot Studio Fireside Chat” Speaker : Dewain Robinson, Principal Solution Architect, Microsoft Copilot Studio (PowerCAT team) In this engaging discussion, Dewain Robinson — known as the “Copilot Studio Dude” for his passion for the technology — shared insights into the present and future of Microsoft Copilot Studio , the platform for building custom AI copilots and agents across Power Platform and Dynamics 365. Robinson revealed that over 230,000 organizations are already using Copilot Studio to build their own AI assistants, demonstrating the massive momentum behind custom copilot development. He detailed new capabilities empowering both business users and pro developers to design AI solutions tailored to their needs. Among the most exciting updates were integrations that allow Copilot agents to access Microsoft 365 data (emails, Teams chats, calendars) and external files for deeper contextual understanding. He also unveiled Computer Use , a breakthrough feature that enables copilots to perform UI actions, such as clicking buttons, copying data, or submitting forms, essentially granting them RPA-like abilities to automate tasks across legacy systems. Additionally, Robinson discussed enhanced analytics and debugging tools that offer visibility into agent performance (accuracy, usage, ROI) and finer control over behavior. This session stood out for its focus on building and scaling AI copilots in enterprise environments. Robinson’s insights into Copilot Studio’s evolution — from integrating with enterprise data via MCP to offering governance and testing tools — showed how Microsoft is enabling organizations to create AI responsibly and effectively.

Service Microsoft INEFOP was juggling customer requests across dozens of separate channels - WhatsApp, email, web portal, phone, and more - with data scattered and inconsistent. By unifying everything through Dynamics 365 Omnichannel, they transformed their customer service into a seamless, efficient system with a complete 360° view of interactions and faster, more reliable support. About the company INEFOP is a tripartite, non-state public entity in Uruguay. While operating as a public organization, it fosters collaboration between the public and private sectors. Its mission is to improve employability through professional training and development. INEFOP provides a wide range of services, including job placement, internships, and professional training courses, with the goal of enhancing individual and organizational skills, expanding employment opportunities, and supporting economic growth. Challenge INEFOP engages with customers through multiple communication channels: in-person visits, WhatsApp, SMS, email, its web portal, and more. However, each channel previously operated in isolation, often using separate systems that did not share information or maintain a complete interaction history. This resulted in: Duplicated and inconsistent customer information across systems. Outdated or incomplete records. Discrepancies, such as issues resolved in one channel still appearing as open in another. As a result, both customers and staff experienced frustration and delays. Solution To address these challenges, INEFOP implemented Dynamics 365 Customer Service with the Omnichannel for Customer Service add-on, consolidating all communication channels into a single, unified platform. Key improvements included: Unified case management: Staff assisting customers by phone, email, chat, or in person can log and track all interactions in Dynamics 365, with visibility into any other open tickets across channels.

    "content": "Home Insights Agents for Good Hackathon DF25: AI Solutions for Real Impact Article October 14, 2025 by Gabriel Juarez Agents for Good Hackathon DF25: AI solutions for real impact Born from a hackathon challenge, this AI-driven project streamlines disaster relief by connecting real-time needs with the right resources faster and more effectively. Service Data and AI Salesforce Industry Enterprise Government Artificial intelligence is transforming how we respond to global challenges, and Dreamforce 2025 is the perfect place to witness that in action. Standing out among the many innovative experiences at the event, the Agents for Good Hackathon DF25 combines technology and empathy. In this blog, we’ll explore the purpose of this hackathon, how we’re participating, and the solution we created to tackle a specific challenge— Global Aidgents , an AI-powered system that uses Salesforce Agentforce to make disaster relief more efficient, transparent, and human-centered. What is the Agents for Good Hackathon? Agents for Good Hackathon DF25 is an innovation challenge taking place at Dreamforce 2025, where participants build AI-driven solutions to tackle real-world issues around trust, equity, and inclusion. It centers on Salesforce’s Agentforce platform, an AI agentic framework providing the tools, guardrails, and integrations for building autonomous agents across Salesforce Clouds. In this hackathon, teams use Agentforce to showcase how AI agents can drive positive social impact. Participants from around the world have collaborated virtually for weeks, with DF25 hosting the final presentations and showcase. How we’re participating Dreamforce is all about learning, networking, and having fun. We’re here to make the most of our participation at the event —rolling up our sleeves and having fun while working on impactful solutions is a true win-win. We come prepared with deep experience building Agentforce solutions in enterprise settings. In our day-to-day work, we’ve implemented Agentforce agents to automate complex business processes for corporate clients. But this event is about collaborating and learning from others’ perspectives. We’re bringing open ears and minds to listen to challenges related to accessibility, inclusion, and equity, and to share how technology can make a real difference. The countless extra hours of dedication are worth it when the reward is seeing technology solve human needs. The challenge: Helping fragmented disaster relief and donation efforts The problem we chose to tackle is the mitigation of inefficiency in disaster relief donations and resource distribution. When a natural disaster strikes, people’s generosity is overwhelming; money, goods, and services start pouring in. However, the systems for managing these donations could be fragmented, slow, or inefficient. Multiple relief organizations and agencies could operate in parallel with little coordination , leading to a disjointed response. Funds and supplies could get spread across various relief organizations without a unified strategy, and critical information not always shared. As a result: Efforts may overlap in one area and miss others entirely Resources could get wasted Some victims could remain underserved You might have noticed we’re choosing our words carefully to avoid generalizations. That’s because there are many organizations and individuals who make unbelievable efforts and carry out mission-critical tasks that save millions of lives. We learned that during our research, but we also need to set the stage for brainstorming responsible AI-driven solutions. Let’s imagine a scenario: several NGOs rush to deliver food to one town, inadvertently neglecting a neighboring region in dire need. This lack of coordination means survivors don’t always receive timely aid, despite ample donations. The on-the-ground chaos of an emergency only amplifies these gaps. From the donor’s perspective , there’s also a transparency problem . People give generously, but then what? Donors often have little visibility into where their money or goods go or what impact they ultimately have. Traditional relief organizations do their best to report back, but the process is opaque and delayed. A donor might get a generic thank-you email or see a public report weeks later. In the modern era, that’s not enough—donors crave real-time reassurance that their contribution made a difference. They look for relief organizations with proven transparency and measurable results. There are several root causes of this challenge: Poor information flow Manual logistics Siloed systems Donor drives, relief NGOs, and local authorities each use their own tools to collect and deploy help, and these systems often don’t communicate with one another. One group might not know what the other is doing in real time. Managing incoming donations (whether money or supplies) and mapping them to evolving needs is still largely manual , relying on phones and spreadsheets that can’t keep up with a fast-moving crisis. Data about what’s needed where (shelter, water, medical supplies, etc.) might exist in situational reports or government feeds, but it’s not automatically linked to donation pipelines. In an era of AI and instant communication , some disaster relief efforts could benefit from smarter, more unified approaches. The solution: Global Aidgents, an AI-powered relief coordinator Our project, Global Aidgents , is an AI-driven agent orchestration system designed to streamline disaster relief donations from start to finish. It acts as a central intelligent coordinator that brings donors, real-time disaster data, and relief organizations onto one platform. In essence, Global Aidgents works like a smart air traffic controller for disaster aid: it constantly monitors what resources are coming in and where help is needed, suggesting the best direction for relief efforts. We understand the importance of keeping humans in the loop as the ultimate decision-makers. While generative AI can uncover hidden patterns and process massive amounts of data in seconds, ethical dilemmas require human judgment. Our goal is to ensure that humans are presented with all the relevant information to make informed and ethical decisions , especially in situations where moral principles may conflict. As Josh Birk highlighted in his Mile High Dreamin ’ keynote, “AI is a prediction calculator, not an ethical or moral one; humans must stay in the loop.” ( Watch here ) Another key factor is accessibility and user experience , crucial elements when designing systems that must support such complex, high-stakes scenarios. How does it all work together? Imagine a hurricane scenario : in the immediate aftermath, people everywhere start donating via different relief organizations’ websites. Normally, these offers flow into separate organizations , often uncoordinated or even idle. With Global Aidgents , all the pledges from a Red Cross donation form, to a local food bank’s app, to someone donating through social media are instantly captured and intelligently routed to where they’re most needed. At the same time, the system pulls in real-time disaster data, analyzing: Government situation reports Social media updates Emergency communications This allows it to identify priorities such as: District X water plant is down → drinking water becomes priority one Hospital Y overwhelmed with injuries → medical supplies and personnel become priority two So, that $100 from a donor in London? Instantly allocated to buy water filters and fuel for delivery trucks. The 500 blankets donated by a company? Flagged for delivery to shelters in District X once clean water distribution is underway. And a team of volunteer nurses in a nearby state? Automatically matched and routed to Hospital Y to reinforce medical staff. The technical approach with existing Salesforce features Leveraging agent-to-agent (A2A) communication , we imagine a network of MCP servers configured to interact and democratize access to information , allowing humans to perform the final step in the allocation process. Tools like Slack allow coordination between multiple organizations, making human connections possible for better collaboration: Jumping into a Huddle (Slack’s quick audio/video call) with people from multiple relief organizations to coordinate resource distribution is just a click away. Agentforce agents are seamlessly integrated with Slack. They can be invoked directly from a Slack channel and paired with flow automations to proactively send messages, for example, after being notified by other external agents about newly available resources. Regarding accessibility and user experience, agents can be equipped with custom LWC components to enrich conversations: Audio messages can be incorporated to provide a practical way for people to interact with agents. This is especially useful in chaotic environments like disaster sites, where stress levels are high and traditional input methods may be difficult to use. Fun fact: Thinking about the perfect solution before truly understanding the problem. Sometimes we’re blinded by a powerful solution promising innovation but requiring huge effort. In our case, we thought sending an audio message to an Agentforce agent would be a differentiator. We explored Vive Coding Text-to-Speech API integrations and native browser capabilities, learning a lot in the process. However, we realized that the cheapest and easiest solution was to leverage the built-in dictation capabilities of computers or phones. Conclusion: Enterprise tech for real-world impact As the hackathon draws to a close, we reflect on what our journey means beyond the event. We came into DF25 as enterprise software experts, spending our days building CRM solutions and AI agents for Fortune 500 companies. We’re used to talking about metrics and efficiency gains. For this project, we challenged ourselves to apply that same expertise to a humanitarian problem. It’s been eye-opening to see how the tools and principles we use every day can be purposed to solve challenges on a human level. We’re excited to learn more about others’ challenges and hopefully inspire teams with solutions like this to turn innovative ideas into real-world impact.

    "content": "Article October 9, 2025 Merging fintech tech stacks? A guide for tech leaders to avoid chaos Fintech acquisition complete? Here’s how to avoid integration failure and key challenges, from tech stack mismatches to team misalignment. Service IT Outsourcing Staff Augmentation Global Capability Centers Industry Financial Services I’ve been through more fintech acquisitions and mergers than I care to count. Enough to know that the real complexity doesn’t start in the boardroom. It starts after the handshakes. Sure, pre-merger is full of challenges. Especially in fintech, where regulation runs deep and international laws don’t always play nicely. But that’s just a warm-up. As a Lead Software Engineer, I’ve seen this unfold again and again. The deal closes, the victory lap isn’t even over, and we’re already on the clock. Product and engineering are under fire to deliver. Roadmaps clash, systems don’t sync, and the pressure builds fast. It’s go time, but often, Architecture and Engineering haven’t had a real seat at the table. Whether it's data pipelines that don’t talk to each other, dev teams using wildly different tooling, or leadership expecting plug-and-play results overnight, it’s a familiar story. How do you break that cycle? From working with clients across tons of Pwrteams projects, here’s what I’ve found. The stakes post-merger or acquisition Mismanaged integrations escalate business problems fast. Most times, when you don’t take the right steps early, the same issues tend to show up: - Toolchains that don’t talk to each other block collaboration. - Ownership is blurred, roles overlapping, or worse, missing. - Deadlines slip, and budgets bloat. - Imbalance. Some engineers are drowning in work, while others are rotting on the bench. - Disorder. Critical tasks get missed, while others are done twice. Most of it stems from one source: Architectural decisions that come late, lack clarity, or happen in a silo. When systems aren’t designed to connect, teams end up patching holes, and quick fixes end up being permanent workarounds. Good news? These issues aren’t new. They’re predictable and in most cases, fixable, provided you act in time. Clear them out early, and you’re setting every team, project, and department up for a smoother run down the line. Where things usually go sideways in fintech acquisitions and mergers When fintech companies merge, integration issues aren’t usually a one big wreck; but slow friction builds over time. What breaks isn’t the tech itself, but the misguided assumptions that stitching it all together won’t be that much work. Tech debt and legacy complexity The challenge in fintech integration is not about Java vs .NET or React vs Angular. It’s about the shape of your inherited systems and whether your team can keep them running. Mergers tend to trip up on the same usual suspects: brittle legacy code, zero documentation, and tangled dependencies no one flagged. If something runs on niche technology no one speaks, in most cases, it's likely safer to migrate than patch. At Funding Circle , we rapidly built a dev team in Sofia that was aligned with their stack (Ruby, Clojure) and embedded it directly into the core staff. Because structure and ownership were clear from day one, we integrated fast and avoided rework. Sometimes, you can wrap legacy systems with adapters. Other times, you need to start from scratch. But that should always be a conscious choice, not a default Data migration and integration risks If I had to pick the single biggest risk in fintech integration (apart from cultural fit), it’s data. Full stop. In fintech, everything runs on information: balances, transactions, compliance logs, and risk scores. Merge that data poorly, and you could lose business, trust, or both. Rule one is don’t cut corners. We’ve seen teams move fast and skip audit event streams, thinking they were secondary. Months later, when regulators asked for records, they couldn’t produce them. The integration isn’t just about copying a database. It’s about syncing events, keeping context intact, and managing transform logic transparently. You’ll need new ETLs. Some pipelines will break. So: document every step, log transformations, and make sure data consumers know where the information is coming from and why it changed. Reconciling tech stacks and systems Different teams bring different philosophies: microservices on one side, a monolith on the other. And while monoliths get a bad rap, they can work just fine if they’re simple and stable. KISS and DRY still matter, especially when combined with a Lean mindset. But if multiple teams are stepping on the same codebase, friction’s unavoidable. In those cases, either merge the teams or start splitting the system. AI can help suggest boundaries for microservices, but don’t treat it as gospel. Use it to challenge assumptions, then make your own calls. When choosing between “merge it” and “break it up,” we ask two things at Nortal: What’s slowing us down? And what will be a nightmare to maintain six months from now? One nearshore team working with c- Quilibrium faced this head-on while extending their cash supply chain management platform. The dedicated Nortal team delivered a tailored .NET and SQL stack that plugged cleanly into their UI and business logic, while respecting the constraints of their existing systems. That kind of alignment lets you extend with confidence instead of rebuilding in a panic. Cultural clash and team misalignment I’ll say it again: Tech is the easy part. After a merger, engineers face unfamiliar tools, rituals, even leadership styles. If team values or delivery habits don’t click, tension builds fast, and it’s a shortcut to turmoil. If cultural alignment is not treated seriously from day zero, teams with different agile maturity levels struggle to sync, key people might leave, and domain knowledge can vanish overnight. That’s why early engagement matters, through retrospectives, joint planning sessions, and honest conversations about how people want to work together. Supporting our clients through that, we’ve used Team Topologies to reshape team structure and Agile coaches to realign delivery rhythms. Just getting teams to share metrics and friction points can reset the tone completely. But it has to be done. Don’t underestimate the soft skills. I’ve pushed for optional training on conflict resolution and async communication – not because engineers are bad at it, but because mergers test everyone’s patience. The success sticks or slips in the people’s part. Missing skills and integration gaps Even the best-prepared teams run into gaps during integration. They hit the wall with cloud migration, event-driven architecture trips people up, and API designs don’t line up. Sometimes the know-how just isn’t there in-house. Without shared domain knowledge, even well-built systems can become hard to run and expand. In that case, where do you start? My recommendation is to figure out where the blank spots are first, and then fill them in fast. Use glossaries, business rule docs, domain models, and workflows, whatever helps people get up to speed quickly and with confidence. Then, build a dedicated integration team focused on foundational work. Also, get Engineering and Architecture leads involved early, to guide that stage. At Nortal, we often jump in at exactly this point, designing integration pipelines, rewriting legacy services, helping different business units talk tech with each other. Sometimes that outside perspective is the missing piece to fill the integration gaps. Hard-earned lessons from the field Mergers are intense. Nobody gets a perfect playbook because variations occur. But after steering plenty of integrations across the finish line, I’ve picked up some invaluable lessons that can only be learned on a living organism. Feel free to build on that: Listen to engineers: Don’t make tech decisions top-down. Run domain workshops, ask teams to estimate integration tasks, and gather proposals before setting a direction. If you ignore early pushback, you’ll pay for it later. Stick to the tools you know, but with a twist: You’ll still write code in your IDE, test APIs with Postman, and deploy to your familiar cloud. But now’s the time to lean on AI (don’t shrug). If you’re not using it to generate unit tests, sketch out integration flows, and suggest changes to API contracts, you’re missing out! I do that daily, always reviewing the output, but saving tons of time. Even generating early domain diagrams or mocking test data can buy you some breathing room. Don’t rush API rewrites: If an API underpins payments or scoring, don’t rebuild it mid-flight. Wrap and adapt it instead, and only plan a rewrite if the owning team can back it up. You don’t want test regressions caused by schema mismatches just because someone disliked the old naming conventions. Prepare for CI/CD changes: This is never a copy-paste job. Infrastructure, pipelines, and security scans vary by company. Compare diagrams, track complexity, and don’t wait for builds to break before aligning on the process. We’ve helped clients migrate from fragmented pipelines to unified CI/CD setups with consistent audit, rollback, and test coverage. Don’t force a methodology: If one team uses Scrum and the other’s on Kanban or something even looser, don’t panic. Start with what works. I’ve onboarded teams by running Lean with simple boards, Slack updates, and lightweight demos. Then, once everyone settled in, we agreed on what to adopt long-term. Finally, don’t do it all in-house: This one’s for the engineering managers. There’s a short window early on when outside help can save you from a ton of future rework. At Nortal, we support clients by prototyping APIs, building integration adapters, rewriting legacy pipelines, and even running full data migrations, while internal engineers stay focused on the product. How to tell your fintech integration is in trouble Sometimes things look fine until you zoom out. So, if you’re wondering whether your integration is on shaky ground, there are a few patterns that show up again and again. These are the early warning signs that something in your architecture, planning, or coordination needs attention. Here’s what I look for. Velocity drop When your teams consistently complete fewer story points over several sprints, it’s often a sign of hidden complexity. Maybe the integration is messier than expected. Maybe old services are harder to work with than anyone thought. Or perhaps nobody has full context on the domain. Either way, velocity dipping without explanation means it’s time to reassess. Requirement volatility index If requirements shift 15–20% (or more) from one sprint to the next, something upstream’s off. I see it all the time when teams start merging KYC, fraud, or scoring systems. You start building with assumptions; mid-sprint, someone flags a missing compliance rule or a critical piece of business logic. Suddenly, the whole thing’s in flux. Technical debt accumulation rate Teams working under pressure sometimes “just get it working.” That’s fine once or twice. But if cutting corners becomes a pattern, you’re stacking up debt that will slow you down later. Watch for workarounds replacing solid architecture. If teams are avoiding writing tests or skipping schema validation just to ship, you’ve got a problem. Integration test pass rate trends Unit tests don’t tell the full story in integrated fintech platforms. If end-to-end tests for loan workflows, transaction paths, or onboarding flows start failing, especially ones that used to pass, that’s a regression you can’t ignore. It often points to misaligned API contracts or business rules shifting underfoot. Cross-team blocking issues When one team constantly waits for another to deliver an API, fix a bug, or clarify a contract, your dependencies aren’t clear enough. We use issue tracker tags to flag blocks. If that list grows sprint to sprint, it’s a signal: integration friction is stalling delivery. What to measure during fintech integration? System health Error rates, CPU/memory spikes, slow response times Business metrics Loan approval time, application-to-offer duration, conversion rates, false positive/negative rates in fraud detection Integration metrics API success/fail rates, message latency, retries User experience Page load time, app responsiveness, drop-off during workflows Deployment metrics How often you deploy, how fast changes hit production, and rollback rates Wrapping up: signs of progress Not all signals are bad. If your fintech integration’s working, you’ll start to feel it even before the dashboards confirm it. Teams begin to move with more confidence. Questions shift from “Who owns this?” to “How do we extend it?” You don’t need emergency meetings to ship features. That’s when you know things are settling in the right direction. Signs of real progress in a fintech integration: Defined ownership Every major function, like risk, onboarding, payments, and support, has a clear owner. Hand-offs are smooth. Questions have a home. Deliberate architecture Services either stay separate on purpose or are being actively merged. Nothing is sitting in a half-integrated limbo. Scalable systems Teams trust the platform to handle growth. You’re not firefighting every spike in loan applications or new feature release. Business continuity index How many core business functions stayed up and stable throughout the integration? We track service availability, error rates, and any user-visible issues. If SLAs are being met without daily drama, you're doing something right. Integration efficiency ratio Did you stay on budget? Did delivery timelines match expectations? This one’s simple: track planned vs. actuals. If the variance is low, you scoped well. If not, use the delta to improve how you plan the next one. Customer impact score Harder to measure, but equally important. This comes from user interviews, friction metrics, and UX feedback. Did response times stay low? Did onboarding flows stay smooth? Are users confused or just using the new system like nothing changed? That’s your signal. Integration is rarely smooth. But it doesn’t have to be upside-down either. I’ve seen teams use a fintech merger as an opportunity to simplify systems, rethink workflows, and even test out new tools like generative AI for rapid prototyping. If you’re deep in it now, don’t just survive it, use it. And if you need a hand, whether that’s architectural help, extra engineering support, or someone to carry the load while your core team focuses, we’ve been there. Just ask, we’re here . The consequences of human error are costly. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report , businesses lose an average of €3.9 million per breach , with phishing and stolen credentials being the top initial attack vectors. Furthermore, 60% of small and medium-sized businesses go out of business within six months of experiencing a cyberattack. Cyber exercising: The cornerstone of cyber resilience Cyber exercises must be integrated into our security strategy to truly strengthen cyber resilience. These structured simulations test an organisation’s readiness against real-world cyber threats. They help teams practice incident response, refine decision-making processes, clarify communications channels, assure roles and responsibilities, test assumptions, hone tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and build confidence in crises. From critical infrastructure to corporate enterprises, cyber exercising equips teams with the practical experience to respond with clarity and speed. Whether defending national infrastructure or safeguarding sensitive customer data, these exercises transform static response plans into living capabilities. Why cyber exercising matters Reveals critical gaps in technical controls, escalation paths, and decision-making workflows. Fosters organisation-wide collaboration, improving coordaination and communication across all roles, functions, and levels. Builds confidence under pressure, giving participants, groups, and organisations muscle memory they can rely on. Exposes participants to real-world attack techniques, improving detection, containment, and familiarity. Strengthens regulatory and stakeholder alignment by stress-testing notification and reporting procedures in a simulated environment. Fosters a culture of continuous improvement by turning lessons from exercises into actionable changes across people, processes, and technologies.

    "content": "Home Insights Architecting Multi‑Region, Multi‑Language Websites with AEM MSM Article September 30, 2025 by Bruno Bradach, AEM Backend Engineer Architecting multi‑region, multi‑language websites with AEM MSM Keeping a large international site is a balancing act. You’ve got to keep the brand consistent, but also leave room to localize content for different languages, cultures, and markets. Service Adobe Adobe Experience Manager’s Multi Site Manager (MSM) provides a powerful framework to achieve this balance. Think of it as your control center for global content. It helps replicate, localize, and manage your digital presence across languages and regions—without chaos. This guide walks through how to design a scalable, sustainable architecture using AEM MSM. Let’s start by revisiting a few key concepts. MSM: The essentials Before moving into a multi-region, multi-language setup in AEM, let’s take a moment to go over the essentials. These core concepts shape how content is structured, shared, and updated across different regions and languages: 01 Blueprint 02 Live copy 03 Language copy‍ 04 Rollout The blueprint is the master source of content, typically located under /content/language-masters/{lang}. It defines the foundational structure and the rollout configuration that governs content synchronization. A live copy replicates content from the blueprint and maintains a live relationship through inheritance. It allows regional customization while still receiving updates from the master source. For example: Blueprint: /content/language-masters/en Live Copy (US): /content/us/en Live Copy (UK): /content/uk/en For a deeper dive, see Adobe’s tutorial on blueprints and live copies. A language copy is a one-time snapshot of content created for translation workflows. Unlike a live copy, it is not connected to the blueprint after creation, making it ideal for external translation processes that require independent editing. A rollout is the process of pushing content updates from the blueprint to its live copies (the regional or localized versions). They can be triggered manually or automatically (e.g., on activation), and are controlled by rollout configurations. For details, see rollout configuration and triggers. What’s the best way to structure your content? A clear, well-defined content hierarchy is the backbone of any scalable multi-region, multi-language setup in AEM MSM. It’s what holds everything together when you’re scaling across regions and languages. Here’s how it should look: content ├── language-masters │ ├── en │ ├── fr │ └── de ├── us │ ├── en │ └── es ├── uk │ └── en ├── de │ └── de └── fr └── fr The /content/language-masters path contains the master content by language. Regional branches (e.g., /us, /uk) are live copies inheriting from the appropriate language master. Regions can support multiple languages — for example, the US can have both English (/us/en) and Spanish (/us/es). This structure allows centralized updates while keeping localized variations clean and manageable. It scales well as you add more languages or regions over time. Common pitfalls & how to avoid them Even with a solid foundation, issues can still surface during day-to-day operations. Here are the usual suspects: Inheritance breakage Local authors may break inheritance, preventing centralized updates from reaching live copies. Excessive live copies Unnecessary live copies can increase system complexity and degrade performance. Poor permission management Without clear governance, local teams may unintentionally change templates, delete inherited components, or misconfigure rollouts. Non-MSM compatible components Custom components not designed with MSM in mind may behave unexpectedly during rollouts, resulting in data loss or overwritten content. These are some of the most common challenges developers may face along the way. But don’t worry. Now that we’ve covered the core concepts and challenges, let’s shift to solutions. Plan before you build Define your content structure, rollout strategy, translation workflows, and permission model before development begins. Limit customization Stick to default rollout configurations where possible to ensure stability and ease future upgrades. Governance and training Restrict advanced permissions and provide clear training to regional authors on how MSM works and what to avoid. Prototype and test Validate your MSM setup with a pilot project that includes rollout, translation, and update scenarios. Manage rollouts carefully Avoid overusing automated triggers such as onModify. Use manual or scheduled rollouts to reduce errors and ensure stability. By planning ahead for common challenges and following these best practices from the start, teams can cut down on maintenance, minimize rollout risks, and keep a consistent, yet adaptable, digital experience across regions. When done right… When properly implemented, AEM MSM enables centralized control over global content while supporting regional flexibility. The key lies in disciplined governance, carefully designed content structures, and a thoughtful rollout strategy. We hope this guide helped clarify the path forward. Start small, validate thoroughly, and scale with confidence. Interested in learning more? Explore our blog for practical insights and technical deep dives.

    "content": "Article September 26, 2025 Building AI teams: strategies for growth, culture, and scalability As AI reshapes how products are built and teams work, many organizations struggle to move from experimentation to real impact. This article breaks down what makes AI teams succeed – from mindset and culture to roles, scalability, and practical challenges, and offers guidance for building AI capabilities that grow with your business. Service IT Outsourcing Staff Augmentation Global Capability Centers AI is reshaping how teams think, work, and build. From healthcare to finance, businesses are using AI to solve complex problems, create efficiencies, and unlock new opportunities. But the road to successful AI adoption is not without its bumps. Many AI projects fail to deliver on their promises, often due to unrealistic expectations, slow adoption rates, and the complexities of integrating AI into existing workflows. Much like the transition from on-premise to cloud computing reshaped product development, AI will fundamentally alter how teams collaborate, iterate, and execute. Traditionally, product development followed a structured process with clear handoffs: PRDs, wireframes, approvals. AI disrupts this. Instead of lengthy documentation cycles, AI-native teams use AI to generate wireframes, automate A/B testing, and analyse user behaviour in real-time, enabling them to make product decisions based on live insights rather than guesswork. This shift reduces ambiguity, accelerates decision-making, and allows for more real-world experimentation. Engineers can take on product management tasks, and product managers can generate data-driven insights without relying on separate analytics teams. This fluidity creates more agile, high-impact teams. So, how do you build an AI team that’s not just functional, but scalable? One that evolves alongside your business needs? Let’s break it down. Why do so many AI projects fail? Major predictions about AI have painted a transformative picture: the World Economic Forum suggested that AI could create 11 millions of new jobs , while Goldman Sachs estimates a potential 7% boost to global GDP . Yet, the narrative has become more nuanced. AI adoption rates have been slower than anticipated, with businesses reporting mixed productivity gains from AI deployments. Microsoft’s Copilot, for example, has faced delays, and CIOs are not universally raving about the returns on their investments. Studies from the Future of Jobs Report 2025 show that organizational silos, skill gaps, and technological readiness remain key bottlenecks. Additionally, many firms overestimate the immediate benefits of AI while underestimating the complexity of aligning AI with existing workflows. Adding to these challenges is a more subtle, human factor. Fear of job displacement or devaluation often prevents employees from fully embracing AI. For many, the idea of relying on AI feels like undermining their own contributions. These fears contribute to hesitation in adoption, even in areas where AI could significantly enhance productivity. What is the mindset and culture of an AI-native team? Technology adoption is surging, with 86% of companies expecting AI to transform their operations by 2030 . Despite these projections, however, the actual adoption of AI is progressing more slowly than many initially expected. Why the gap? The common challenges, like learning how to prompt AI or integrate it into workflows, are significant, but there’s another, more intangible barrier. For many, using AI feels like cheating . We’re conditioned to value hard work and original ideas. But AI disrupts both. When it can brainstorm better ideas or compress hours of work into minutes, it’s easy to feel like we’re cutting corners. Almost half of desk workers in a Slack study admitted they’d feel uncomfortable telling their manager they used AI, fearing it would make th em seem lazy or less competent. The feeling of “cheating” with AI stems from outdated ideas about value. Instead of seeing AI as a shortcut, think of it as a collaboration tool that amplifies your strengths. If AI helps you solve problems faster, you have more time for creative thinking, strategic planning, or connecting with your team. Great AI teams don’t just adopt AI - they experiment with it. They test, tweak, and embrace failure as part of the learning process. Encouraging experimentation, celebrating AI-augmented results, and reframing success as a blend of human and machine effort can transform attitudes. To build an AI-native team , foster a culture where AI is seen as a collaborator, not a competitor. Why does scalability & AI-native product development matter? Let’s put aside all the stories about why AI projects are failing for a moment and focus on a different scenario: what happens when your AI project gains traction and achieves success? Success brings its own set of challenges. What do you do when demand skyrockets and expectations for your AI solutions grow exponentially? Can your team keep up? For AI to drive long-term value, your team must adapt to growing data, increasing complexity, and shifting business goals. Even the most groundbreaking ideas can crumble under pressure without a scalable AI team. In a field that changes almost daily, scalability isn’t about headcount, but about adaptability. The best teams don’t just grow, they evolve. How to scale AI teams beyond the headcount? Effectively scaling an AI team isn’t just about expanding the workforce, it’s about making AI a force multiplier for efficiency and adaptability. True scalability means building a self-learning, self-optimising system that enhances the team’s capabilities without just increasing the number of employees. By embracing automation, AI-driven workflows, and cross-functional adoption, businesses can scale their AI teams and entire AI capability without needing massive headcount increases. The future of AI scalability is about working smarter, not just bigger. What does a scalable AI team look like? Hint: it’s not just a room full of data scientists Building a high-performing AI team isn’t about cramming a room full of data scientists. It’s about assembling a group with diverse skill sets and perspectives to tackle the many layers of AI projects. According to the WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 , roles like AI specialists, machine learning engineers, and data analysts are growing rapidly as organisations embrace AI-driven solutions. Here’s what an AI team usually looks like: Data Engineers : These are the architects of your data pipeline, ensuring it’s clean, accessible, and primed for AI models. Without them, even the most sophisticated algorithms fall flat. With only 12% of organisations reporting data readiness for AI integration, their role is non-negotiable. Machine Learning Engineers : The bridge between research and reality. They take prototypes and transform them into scalable, reliable systems. Demand for these skills has surged, reflecting the growing need to operationalise AI solutions. AI Product Managers : These strategists align AI projects with business goals, ensuring measurable outcomes. As companies increasingly weave AI into their operations, these roles are critical for connecting the dots across teams and priorities. Domain Experts : Industry know-how matters. These specialists bring context to AI, ensuring solutions address real-world problems. The ability to pair technical expertise with skills like critical thinking and problem-solving makes them indispensable. And it doesn’t stop there. The WEF report highlights the rise of new roles, such as AI ethicists and automation strategists , which will be vital as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday business. Great AI teams don’t just blend technical, strategic, and domain expertise. They also prepare for the future, navigating ethical challenges & embracing new opportunities. What are the key challenges in building an AI team? Building an AI team isn’t as simple as posting job ads for data scientists. The challenges go beyond recruitment, touching on strategy, culture, and infrastructure. Here are some of the biggest hurdles. Talent shortages The demand for AI talent far exceeds supply, with roles like data engineers and machine learning specialists topping global skills shortages. Competing with tech giants and well-funded startups for top-tier professionals is tough, especially when many organisations lack the resources or brand appeal to attract top talent. One way to overcome this challenge is to explore global talent markets . We operate in Bulgaria, Poland, and Ukraine , where thriving tech sectors, strong STEM education, and deep AI/ML expertise make it easier to build AI teams without competing head-to-head with Silicon Valley. Talent retention Hiring is just the beginning. Keeping your AI experts engaged and aligned with your vision requires intentional efforts: competitive compensation, clear career paths, and meaningful work. A lack of ongoing learning opportunities is one of the main reasons AI specialists jump ship. Are you offering the environment they need to thrive? Integration issues AI teams often work in silos, isolated from other departments. This disconnection can lead to misaligned goals and inefficient workflows. Bridging the gap requires fostering cross-functional collaboration and ensuring your AI initiatives integrate seamlessly with broader business strategies. Infrastructure readiness AI thrives on good infrastructure, clean data pipelines, powerful computational resources, and governance frameworks. According to recent studies, only 12% of organisations report having data of sufficient quality and accessibility for effective AI implementation, leaving them ill-equipped to support complex projects. Without the right foundation, even the best talent won’t be enough to succeed. Ethical and regulatory challenges As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical concerns and regulatory requirements are growing. Organisations must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to ensure algorithmic fairness and comply with data protection laws to avoid reputational risks and legal setbacks. Adapting to evolving needs The AI field moves fast. Skills that are essential today may be outdated tomorrow. Staying competitive means continuously upskilling your team, adopting new tools, and being flexible enough to pivot as technology evolves. Practical steps for CTOs and CIOs Building a scalable AI team requires more than hiring talented individuals; it involves creating an environment where technology and people work together seamlessly. Here’s how to get started. Foster a growth mindset To succeed in the AI era, your team must embrace the idea of AI as a collaborator, not a competitor. This requires a cultural shift where experimentation with AI tools is encouraged, and failures are seen as learning opportunities. For example, introduce workshops or training sessions that demystify AI and showcase how it can enhance their roles rather than replace them. Highlight success stories within your organisation to inspire confidence in AI’s potential. Invest in infrastructure AI thrives on robust infrastructure – data pipelines, computational power, and cloud-based systems. Conduct an audit of your current technological capabilities to identify gaps. For example, if your organisation struggles with siloed data, focus on integrating systems and ensuring data cleanliness before implementing AI solutions. Think of infrastructure as the foundation for scalability. Without it, even the most promising AI initiatives will falter. Partner strategically No organisation can tackle the challenges of AI adoption alone. Strategic partnerships can fill skill gaps and accelerate your team’s learning curve. For instance, partnering with an experienced provider like Nortal allows you to tap into a pool of seasoned AI talent – be it Python Developers, Machine Learning Engineers, or Data Scientists. Collaborate with external experts to integrate best practices and ensure your AI initiatives align with business goals. Stay ahead of trends To future-proof your team, monitor emerging roles like AI ethicists, automation strategists, or data translators, and identify how these can support your organisation’s long-term objectives . Regularly review your team’s skill sets and provide upskilling opportunities, ensuring they remain relevant in this ever-changing environment. Hosting knowledge-sharing sessions or participating in industry conferences can also help your team stay informed. AI is evolving so fast that everything feels like quicksand From business growth to customer expectations, product-market fit to productivity, and even technology adoption, nothing stands still. Employees worry about job security, tech leaders struggle to make the right bets, and upskilling feels impossible with new tools emerging daily. While some race ahead, others risk being left behind. No one has it all figured out. But one thing we do know: building strong AI teams requires adaptability, creativity, and a commitment to learning. And that’s exactly what we focus on.

    "content": "Article September 18, 2025 by Ahti Rossi, Project Manager, Nortal Finland EU Data Act unlocks industrial IoT data: here’s what it means for you With the EU Data Act now in effect, manufacturers gain full rights to their machine-generated data, unlocking new ways to optimize operations, cut costs, and drive innovation in industrial IoT. Service Industry Data and AI Manufacturing Industry Data and AI You own the machine. You run the operations. You generate the data. Yet in many cases, accessing that data isn’t straightforward. For years, industrial data has often been tied to vendor ecosystems , bundled into service packages that limit flexibility and visibility. But that’s about to change. The EU Data Act gives you, the machine user , the legal right to access and use your data freely. This isn’t just a regulatory update — it’s a strategic opportunity to take back control and future-proof your operations. Have you ever felt disconnected from the machine data in your own facility? If so, you’re not alone. In many factories and other industrial facilities, machines quietly generate vast amounts of valuable data. However, accessing this data often means committing to expensive vendor ecosystems. Typically, the data flows from the machine straight into the manufacturer’s cloud, where it’s packaged with dashboards, predictive tools, and other features that may not align with your needs or budget. Even if you only need raw signals, you may be required to commit to the full suite and still face limitations in format, speed, or usability. That’s about to change. On Friday, September 12, 2025, the EU Data Act came into effect , marking a shift in how industrial data is governed. The Data Act will grant you, as the machine user, the legal right to access and use the data your equipment produces, including historical data. This shift isn’t just a regulatory update but more like a strategic opportunity to rethink how data supports your operations and innovation. W hat the Data Act r eally g rants y ou The key concept of the EU Data Act is that vendors delivering connected machines or offering related services must provide machine users with access to the data generated by those products (defined in Chapter II: “Business to consumer and business to business data sharing”). Also, users should be able to request their data through a simple process, and data holders must provide it free of charge. Chapter II applies to all raw and pre-processed data generated from the use of a connected machine or related service, whether from a single sensor or a set of sensors, if the data is readily available to the vendor. The data can be, for example: temperature, pressure, flow rates audio, pH, liquid levels position, acceleration, or speed What’s not in the scope of the obligation is inferred or derived data and content, such as highly enriched datasets or audiovisual material that a vendor has created from the raw data. That’s fair to vendors: if users want that enriched layer, vendors are still able to offer this as a paid service. This encourages vendors to build genuine, value‑added services based on know-how and expertise, rather than simply charging for raw data access. It is worth noting that the Data Act obligations may also be interpreted to cover historical data created before the Act comes into effect in September 2025, as suggested in Chapter II. This means that data should be made available if it has been retained within a reasonable timeframe and remains technically accessible. While the definition for “reasonable timeframe” may be vague, it could be interpreted as data that is still relevant and technically usable for its original purpose. Additionally, suppose an equipment manufacturer’s own service, like a dashboard, relies on historical data and covers a specific period of historical data. In that case, the same period is also a reasonable expectation for customers’ access. S tarting on September 12, 2026, the Data Act also requires that every new connected product and associated service sold in the EU must be designed and built to ensure that operational data and metadata are eas il y and directly access ible , secure, free of charge, and provided in a structured, machine-readable format. This requirement will be in effect within 12 months of that date. How the Data Act regulates contractual imbalance in enforcing fairness The Data Act protects data users from take ‑ it ‑ or ‑ leave ‑ it data clauses in contracts between enterprises (defined in Chapter IV “Unfair contractual terms related to data access and use between enterprises”). Suppose a vendor with the stronger bargaining position unilaterally imposes a term that is significantly out of line with good commercial practice and contrary to good faith and fair dealing. In that case, that term can be deemed non ‑ binding. Contractual freedom still stands, however: many terms favoring one side are perfectly acceptable. However, a clause crosses the line when it objectively prevents the other party from protecting its legitimate commercial interests in the data. The practical impact of this clause in the Data Act will ultimately be shaped by real-world application. Debates are likely to emerge around what constitutes “unfair” or “unilaterally imposed” terms in B2B data contracts, and only time will tell how Chapter IV will be interpreted and enforced in practice. The EU Commission has introduced model contractual terms and standard contractual clauses to be used as a voluntary benchmark for what “good” contractual practice looks like in data sharing and cloud services. The consequences of human error are costly. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report , businesses lose an average of €3.9 million per breach , with phishing and stolen credentials being the top initial attack vectors. Furthermore, 60% of small and medium-sized businesses go out of business within six months of experiencing a cyberattack. Open data pathways ease switching and pave the way for interoperability The EU Data Act doesn’t just give you access to your data, it ensures you can take it with you. From January 2027, switching between data processing services must be free of charge (as of January 12, 2027, but switching fees have already been reduced since January 2024), fast, and fluid (defined in Chapter VI “Switching between data processing services”). This is a direct strike against long-standing vendor lock-in practices. The new rules are designed to break down the barriers that keep businesses locked into single providers. By making contracts clearer and data more portable, the EU aims to make the digital market more open and competitive. Companies should be able to move their data freely without being held back by technical limitations or restrictive agreements. That said, the impact on machine-generated data may be limited at first. Much of this data originates from proprietary automation or control systems, which are not yet designed to support open or alternative data access interfaces. This will begin to change on September 12, 2026, when new equipment design obligations take effect, requiring that connected products and related services be built with easy and secure access to operational data. But portability alone isn’t enough. For data to be truly usable across systems, it must also be interoperable (defined in Chapter VIII “Interoperability”). That’s why the Act mandates data flow within and between data spaces, facilitated by clear documentation on data structures, formats, and vocabularies. Even if full switching isn’t yet technically feasible in all cases, good documentation already makes a difference. It enables businesses to integrate and build value on top of existing systems, laying the groundwork for a more open and competitive digital ecosystem. Cyber exercising: The cornerstone of cyber resilience Cyber exercises must be integrated into our security strategy to truly strengthen cyber resilience. These structured simulations test an organisation’s readiness against real-world cyber threats. They help teams practice incident response, refine decision-making processes, clarify communications channels, assure roles and responsibilities, test assumptions, hone tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and build confidence in crises. From critical infrastructure to corporate enterprises, cyber exercising equips teams with the practical experience to respond with clarity and speed. Whether defending national infrastructure or safeguarding sensitive customer data, these exercises transform static response plans into living capabilities. Make the most of the Data Act opportunities The EU Data Act signals a fundamental change in the dynamics of industrial data. Instead of locking data behind proprietary walls, it opens the door for machine users to tap into the raw information they need to drive innovation. This shift challenges vendors to rethink their role - not as gatekeepers, but as enablers - creating value through services and solutions rather than control. This shift is already reshaping the industrial landscape. At Nortal, we help customers navigate this kind of transition , especially when systems were previously closed. When raw data, like simple counter readings, becomes openly accessible, building modern data platforms becomes significantly easier. And when customers want to analyze or enrich that data, it opens the door to new kinds of digital services that go beyond just offering access and actually delivering insight and impact. This evolution challenges equipment vendors to rethink their digital offerings. Simply providing access to data is no longer enough. They must create services that do something genuinely useful with it. That’s a win for everyone: users gain flexibility and control, and vendors are pushed to innovate. Looking ahead, new investments should be made with data access in mind. Procurement contracts should explicitly guarantee access to the minimum operational data required for effective monitoring and optimization. This principle is reinforced by Chapter II, Article 3 of the Data Act, which mandates that all connected products and related services placed on the EU market after September 12, 2026, must be designed to ensure that such data — and its metadata — is easily, securely, and freely accessible to users in a structured, machine-readable format, and, where feasible, directly accessible. But don’t wait for regulation to do the heavy lifting. Treat data access as a legal checkbox and a strategic lever for agility and competitiveness. Avoid vendor-controlled platforms that limit your visibility. Challenge your suppliers. And most importantly, ensure your future investments align with the ideology of openness and interoperability.
