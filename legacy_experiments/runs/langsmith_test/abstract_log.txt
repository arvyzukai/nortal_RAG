-> Score: 3/10. Reasoning: The assistant's answer is accurate in acknowledging the lack of information provided in the context, which is a fair response when the necessary details are not available. However, it lacks completeness and relevance as it does not attempt to provide any information or context about 'Personal Government' as described by Nortal. A more helpful response could have included a general explanation or an attempt to infer from related concepts, even if the specific term was not directly mentioned in the provided context. This would have demonstrated a better understanding and engagement with the question.

-> Score: 8/10. Reasoning: The Assistant Answer provides a comprehensive overview of Nortal's contributions to the Defence sector, aligning well with the Reference Answer. It accurately highlights key areas such as resilience, decision-making, and digital infrastructure modernization, which are relevant to the Reference Answer's focus on digital transformation and decision advantage. Additionally, the Assistant Answer introduces specific examples, such as the collaboration with Hanwha Aerospace and the BOA framework, which add depth and specificity to the response.

However, the Assistant Answer could improve by explicitly mentioning 'cyber force protection' and 'secure architecture,' which are key elements in the Reference Answer. Including these aspects would enhance the completeness and alignment with the Reference Answer, justifying a higher score.

-> Score: 9/10. Reasoning: The Assistant Answer closely mirrors the Reference Answer in terms of accuracy, completeness, and relevance. It effectively captures the essence of 'System-level efficiency' by emphasizing the importance of trust, capacity, and adaptability in digital governance. Additionally, it introduces strategic factors like complexity, resilience, sustainability, and digital sovereignty, which enrich the explanation without deviating from the core concept. The only minor point of deviation is the introduction of these additional factors, which, while relevant, were not mentioned in the Reference Answer. This slight difference accounts for the score of 9 instead of a perfect 10.
